#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

There was an offer by a bank in which I have an account so she requested me to get the offer from my card and I hesitatingly accepted it. 

First 4 months she paid back the EMI amount that got debited from my account on time. 

But now she won’t accept my calls and WhatsApp is also one tick so she may have blocked me. She hasn’t paid back two EMI debits and my bank balance has gone in negative. I have to do my shopping on my credit card now. 

I went online on netbanking but I couldn’t find any option for ongoing EMIs. 

Total amount of the laptop was around 1,40,000 and she paid me back around 28,000 and now she owes me around 14,000. 

How royally am I fucked and is there something I can do about it now? There is still about 98,000 of payments left to go according to the original value of the laptop.",Business/Finance

In India, I notice that a lot of people depend on religion to ease their anxieties around these issues. For a lot of people, there is no certainty around income, there is no accessibility to health care. This creates massive anxieties. People turn to religion as a way to cope with these anxieties.

You can also contrast Western Europe, which is not very religious, with the USA, which, in comparison, is highly religious. Most countries in Western Europe have a reasonable social security program and healthcare for all. The US, on the other hand, has highly conditional social security and very low healthcare access and affordability. I am not arguing that the US also has great technology in healthcare but that accessibility is low because of issues and expenses of health insurance. Similarly, social security is available in the US but is difficult, and often humiliating, to access. This creates huge anxieties around food, shelter and healthcare. Interestingly, America is a much more religious society than Western Europe. Is this a coincidence?

I am also not arguing that there are no outliers. That is, there are a lot of rich people who have access to healthcare who are very religious. Similarly, there might be poor atheists. These outliers can be explained by the fact that everyone's personal journey is different and various types of life events might result in different views on religion.

77,Horlics Chocolate Powder vs Cadbury Cocoa Powder,16,g3lncu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3lncu/horlics_chocolate_powder_vs_cadbury_cocoa_powder/,18,"TLDR: Had loads of time so I compared two chocolate powder products. I bought one of them. 

Long form: So I wanted to purchase a chocolate powder and I have tried both in the past so I was wondering which to buy this time. 

For 215 you get the 500 gms horlicks powder which is pretty good. And for 210 you get 150 gms cadbury powder. The choice seems obvious. Plus Cocoa is bitter so the cadbury powder requires you to add more sugar to make your chocolate shake more pleasant. But since I have nothing better to do today I went deeper.

The Horlics nutrition chart shows that each 100gms contain 78gm carbs of which 30gms are sugar.

Cadbury shows each 100gms contain 52gm carb of which 1.7gm is sugar. 

That means that horlics is 30% sugar. and cadbury is 1% sugar. 

30 fucking percent sugar? fuck that. 

Lets go even deeper.

With cadbury I usually toss in a little under 1 tablespoon powder (10 gms) with a  teaspoon of sugar in my milkshake (4gms)

With horlics I usually toss in 2 big tablespoon powder (~30 gms). so thats 9gms sugar? Sometimes I add more sugar. idk. 

Lets go per serving now.

With cabury, 1 serving = 10 gms. so one box is 15 servings?

With horlicks, 1 serving - 30 gms. So one box is 16.5 servings

So I bought the cocoa.

You can make the comparison yourself:

### Tl; dr

IFF’s Working Paper on [***Privacy Prescriptions for Technology Interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view), affords significant space to the issue of contact tracing technologies. In Chapter 8 it offers a preliminary breakdown of the recently announced partnership between Apple and Google to provide a digital contact tracing solution. In this post we provide some insights into our working paper’s analysis of the partnership through the lens of what’s good, possible risks and the project’s relevance for India. For more texture, please read our working paper, and feel free to provide us with feedback on how we can improve our findings.

### Background | The Promise of Scale and Privacy

Even as the Aarogya Setu application [**crosses the 50 million download mark**](https://theprint.in/tech/aarogya-setu-is-fastest-app-in-the-world-to-reach-50-million-users-despite-privacy-concerns/403025/), there is another project which people should take notice of. On April 10, 2020 Apple and Google [**announced**](https://www.apple.com/in/newsroom/2020/04/apple-and-google-partner-on-covid-19-contact-tracing-technology/) a partnership where they will collaborate on an interoperable contact tracing partnership. Considering they are the world’s two largest operating system (OS) providers for smartphones, they have the scale to potentially offer these facilities to in excess of 3 billion users globally.

The companies are positioning the system as a voluntary opt in system. It will be designed to notify users if they have come in contact with an infected individual. Subsequently, it will offer users recommended courses of action which may range from quarantine to self isolation.

This development essentially reflects earlier recommendations of technologists and stakeholders. Since these are pre existing infrastructures, stakeholders suggest that it may be a viable alternative to creating new surveillance systems installed and monitored by government.

In particular OS providers have been viewed as a promising alternative since these parties have considerable experience in deploying privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy or homomorphic encryption.

### Proposed Timelines

Demonstrating the long term nature of the global response to COVID-19, and the way contact tracing systems are increasingly linked with the reopening of future economic activities, the plan is to introduce the system in two phases.

1. In **Phase 1** (to commence in **May, 2020**) public health authorities will be given the capability to run apps in which iPhones and Android phones will be able exchange information anonymously with one another. The design will allow users of the public health app to voluntarily notify the system if they test positive for COVID-19. Then users which were in close proximity in the last few days will be notified that such contact was made. The default timeline for this check will be 14 days. However, health authorities will have the discretion to amend this.
2. **Phase 2** will be administered over the course of a few months. This update to the programme will essentially reflect the recommendations discussed earlier. The contact tracing software will be embedded into the operating system itself, which removes the need for users to download an application. This functionality will also be opt-in but the potential for this solution to scale is enormous and brings with its own set of opportunities and risks.

### The Project Emphasises Individual Privacy

To reassure people on privacy, Google and Apple stressed on the fact that consent will be baked into its design and they will not collect location data. To their credit, after the publication of our working paper the two parties have [**announced**](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-and-google-say-they-will-shut-down-covid-19-tracking-tools-once-pandemic-ends/) that they intend to terminate the systems once the COVID-19 pandemic ends. While this is a good step, given the uncertain nature of timelines in relation to the coronavirus there is a need for greater specificity and transparency on this front, and is not enough to allay concerns of permanence.

Coming to technical aspects of the project, it stresses that users will not be informed whom they came in contact with, or where the contact takes place. The companies will also not be able to access this data and the entire system can be shut down, if required.  Similar to Singapore’s *TraceTogether* application and other global projects discussed in IFF’s Working Paper the proposed project will be based on Bluetooth. Once contact is established, devices exchange anonymous device identifiers (which are updated for every user’s device on a daily basis), which confirm a timestamped interaction. To enhance people’s privacy, anonymous digital identifiers will change roughly every fifteen minutes. The [**inconsistency**](https://internetfreedom.in/is-aarogya-setu-privacy-first-nope-but-it-could-be-if-the-government-wanted/) with the Aarogya Setu app’s own efforts at privacy protections, data minimisation and obfuscation is apparent.

Should an individual test positive for COVID-19, the person has the ability to enter their diagnosis into a corresponding app which is designed for health agencies. This application then must seek the consent of users to export their “close proximity” interactions which have been recorded in the days prior to diagnosis. This data which has been exported is stored temporarily in a remote server for 14 days. Again here it shows the level of agency and control being afforded to people and their personal data. Indeed, this ethos has even been reflected in other promising contact tracing models studied by our Working Paper.

When it comes to the devices of the people who have made contact with this diagnosed person, the process flow is as follows. First the phone will check the server periodically to assess if any of its identifier keys are linked with COVID-19 positive cases. All positive keys are downloaded back on to this individual’s phone and matched anonymously for validation purposes. When matched, a notification is sent to the other person’s phone along with suggestions from health agencies on how they can quarantine and self-isolate.

The project aims to create a common standard of interaction between different technologists and public health authorities across the world. The two firms state that privacy, transparency and consent will be underlying pillars of this project. The actual solution will also be informed by the inputs of other stakeholders. To further transparency, they have published specifications for Bluetooth, cryptography (i.e. encryption) and API frameworks. As of now information on accountability mechanisms remains difficult to discern.

### Risks Arising from the Project

One of the large outcomes of the coronavirus’ impact in relation to people’s increased dependence on information and communication technologies provided by big tech companies. Considering the fact that contact tracing solutions require the processing of highly sensitive personal information including health records, and insights on people’s movements and/or interpersonal communications, there is an added layer of complexity when these systems are managed by private sector behemoths. It is imperative that any private sector driven response to digital contact tracing must adequately tackle issues of transparency, consent, purpose limitation, and corporate objectives.

When private actors are entrusted for such projects, there is a need to engender public trust. Name recognition and brand of course, help with this trust, but trust also covers facets like safety, privacy and reliability. At a minimum these businesses must also have to comply on principles of (1) specific limited purpose, where there is a specified end data and a defined outcome to the project; (2) complete transparency; and (3) strong enforcement mechanisms which can hold these businesses accountable and protect people’s fundamental rights to informational privacy.

Stringent checks and balances are important to consider, since the creation of new systems, even if they are characterised as temporary, are difficult to roll back. Aside from these general risks, when analysing the project announced by Apple and Google, we must stay vigilant in a few distinct ways.

* **Negotiating Government Use of Personal Data:** The project discusses a system wherein once users of the application are diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, they can export their records from the prior few days on to an external server. This external server allows public health officials to access relevant records. Since, this means health departments in governments are granted access to people’s personal data, there is an onus to ensure use limitations.  Under the guise of contact tracing, health authorities should not be allowed to share such information and insights towards civil liberty restrictions. For example, Apple and Google will have to update the public on how its systems can and cannot be used by governments.
* **Issues of Competition and Conflict of Interest:** Competition authorities and policymakers must carefully scrutinise this project, in an ex-ante manner. This is because it may severely deter competition and innovation in a crucial area of urgent public interest. There is a need to consider conflicts of interest at two levels. In the project’s first phase, Apple and Google will be competing with other applications developed by other groups, companies, consortiums, researchers, and governments. In this context, there is a need for oversight on how *App Store* and *Play Store* treats its application(s) in comparison to other similar solutions.  Second, as the project evolves and integrates itself into the operating system, we need to evaluate what it will mean for innovation in the space. Does the project envision a means to be interoperable with other operating system providers in smartphone and feature phone markets. Such systems should not leave us in a paradigm with one digital contact tracing solution where large technology firms and governments have unimpeachable control over the system. To mitigate such risks, there may be an overriding need to administer ex-ante impact assessments-- both economic and rights oriented.
* **Should Such Projects Be Administered by Pureplay Corporate Structures:** At a fundamental level, it is also important to consider the validity of such projects being administered in a purely corporate structure. Considering the overarching public interest in global responses to COVID-19 and the human rights implications of contact tracing, should these solutions and the supporting infrastructures, be categorised as public digital infrastructures? Instead, should there be regulated access to public-private models? Or should it merely be regulated opportunities for private actors to participate? While the model remains unknown, there is a need to have an expedited conversation on this front.

### Relevance for India and What’s Next?

It is important to highlight that India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) is undertaking a consultation which is relevant to this issue. In particular under May 31, 2020 stakeholders may submit suggestions to a white paper toward a national strategy on National Open Digital Ecosystems. IFF’s submission will address the whitepaper/consultation’s interlinkages with such conversations in its substantive response.

Based on public feedback, IFF intends to update its findings and recommendations to its working paper and share it directly with stakeholders involved in crucial decision making processes.

So I heard about Asur from Reddit where op praises the show, so checked IMDb, it had a rating of 8.7 so I decided to give it a shot.
Watched it within 2 days and was completely disappointed .
The show is full of plot holes some of these are,
* The police couldn't find a coffin in freshly dug grave within a limited area.
No one noticed the reverse clock until our protagonist points it out.(ep 3)
* Hacking the nic using codes from geekforgeeks.
*Oxygen chamber having timer instead of an oximeter. Also the clock speed up when hostages are idle but works Normal when they're trying to kill eachother where oxygen consumption is increased.

You can guess what is going to happen next it just blatantly shows who are bad guys, no misdirection, nothing.

The show just copies elements from shows like mentalist, mindhunter ,Sherlock , Dexter and mix with Indian mythology and some scientific words.

The show fools the viewers into thinking it is smart which the show clearly isn't.

Only thing which is good is the soundtrack.
A complete disappointment.

My rating 6.5/10.",Non-Political

I'm just trying to find others intrested in geopolitics and international relations and have (what could be) a wonderful discussion.

Post the pandemic, China is gonna be facing a shit storm and India is definitely a country they want on their side.

China is being ""kind and generous"" to India with donations of protective gear and has also promised to help produce ventilators, etc. 
India on the other hand has not blamed China for the outbreak dispite the followers of the populist govt. criticizing china and (what appears to be state backing) media shit talking about china too.

Sino-Indian relationship has always been mature and dignified, unlike Indo-Pak relations. And both India and China are wonderful at playing their cards on the geopolitical table.

Given the situation, and the slightly underwhelming govt and it's international relations, what do you think India will get out of this situation ?

Will the govt. be content with masks and ventilators? 
Will they push as far as permanant membership in P5 (possibly ruining relations with japan) (unlikely, I know.) ?
Is it likely India will criticize and blame china for lack of transparency and take a moral high (and diplomatic relations low) road ?  
How far do you think India will go ?

Keep in mind that the last time China fucked up (1990s after Tiananmen square) India pushed for Peace and Tranquility Agreement.

119,"TIL that in UP and Bihar, almost six out of ten deaths were not registered in the death statistics (based on the latest available CRS data from 2017)",4,g3n6wq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3n6wq/til_that_in_up_and_bihar_almost_six_out_of_ten/,0,"  
TL;DR, India lacks systematic registration of deaths even in the absence of the current pandemic. It would be extremely optimistic to assume that the deceased numbers being reported are comprehensive and cover all deaths due to covid-19. If anything, the real number of deaths can only expected to be higher.

  
There have been several claims recently that the number of deaths are lower in India than other nations and this is being seen as an indicator of India's success in controlling the fatality due to the pandemic. In a recent discussion with a friend, a medical professional, while we both agreed that more testing was needed, a question came up whether or not the number of deaths depicts the real picture on the ground. From my point of view, I was not too sure whether in India all deaths were actually being registered in a normal scenario. My friend was however convinced that all births and deaths were always registered, and hence there is no doubt that India is seeing a lower mortality rate as we are counting the number of positive cases and resulting deaths. Additional deaths resulting from untested cases would still have caused a spike in total deaths as all deaths and causes of deaths are normally always reported.

Today, I was trying to find official population statistics regarding the number of births and deaths in India. These numbers are usually provided by the census-related offices of a country. For India, it seems that the latest reported data from the country wide Civil Registration System (CRS) regarding number of births and deaths is from 2017 (annual report at [http://crsorgi.gov.in/annual-report.html](http://crsorgi.gov.in/annual-report.html)).

I was surprised to know that (refer: Table 5 on page 61 of the annual report):

1. In 2017 the overall level of death registration in India was around 80% (i.e. 8 out of 10 deaths are actually reported).
2. State-wise, the level of registration was only around 40% in some of the high population states like UP and Bihar. This means, 6 out of 10 deaths are not even officially registered! This is the official data from 2017, and it has nothing to do with current pandemic.

Moreover, even for the registered deaths, the quality of data regarding the actual cause of death is extremely poor. The ""cause of death"" was identified in less than 20% of the cases (Source article: [https://theprint.in/opinion/indian-health-data-will-miss-recording-many-covid-and-lockdown-deaths/403432/](https://theprint.in/opinion/indian-health-data-will-miss-recording-many-covid-and-lockdown-deaths/403432/))

Given these statistics, it would be extremely optimistic for anyone to assume that the numbers being reported are comprehensive and cover all deaths due to covid-19. If anything, **the real number of deaths can only expected to be higher**. 

These are challenging times, and each one of us has the responsibility to be vigilant so as not to spread misinformation and false claims just to feel a little good about ourselves. We need to test more and more people (as most other countries have been doing) and adopt a transparent reporting mechanism of the numbers (tested/positive/recovered/dead). It is clear that in the case of India, we also need massive improvements and transparency in systematic and quality registration and reporting of the births and deaths.",Coronavirus

India is one of the few countries that have a low percentage of confirmed coronavirus cases. This is due to the Indian government's willingness to care for its citizens and for the citizens of other countries.

Recently, many Western and some Eastern governments have found China's emergency aid to be faulty; however, **there are no reported cases of faulty emergency aid from India**; in fact, India supplies over 30 countries, even the United States, with hydroxychloroquine, a drug that is currently being tested as a treatment for coronavirus. I applaud the Indian government and the Indian people for doing their part in fighting the coronavirus.

Because India has a large skilled labor force, I believe that, if enough of us convince government officials in India and other countries, to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, we can assure high-quality emergency aid for recipient countries and provide more jobs in the growing Indian workforce.

In addition, if enough countries are willing to invest in 'Made in India' emergency aid, they are probably going to offer additional money towards other parts of the Indian government's expenses, such as India's defense budget.

I recommend contacting your representative/senator/Minister of Parliament/etc. ASAP.

I wish you all the best of luck during such a challenging period of our lives.

*This is not a shitpost on the Chinese government or on Chinese people, because I know that there are good and bad people in all countries; however, we must hold all countries accountable for their actions, and China's faulty emergency aid is no exception. In my opinion, the Chinese and United States governments haven't done enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but India is a good example of a country that puts its people first.*",Coronavirus

207,Why is the Modified Media continuously playing the same propaganda themes again and again? It is by design not by chance. Here are some thoughts on this,51,g318gs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g318gs/why_is_the_modified_media_continuously_playing/,7,"First of all  It's a feature not a bug. And is being consistently working towards its goal.

The way media is behaving in last few years, it seems we are inching more and more towards a totalitarian form of government. The idea that media can be effectively used to control and sway public sentiments is not new. One of the earliest major successes stories when the media was used in this manner comes from Nazi Germany. I will quote some relevant paragraphs from [Mein Kampf](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.54153/page/n3/mode/2up) (particularly Chapter 6 War Propaganda) which seems to be like the cookbook for our present incumbents.

Second it is not dumb. In case you are wondering that the ""intellectual level"" of the media has dropped, it is talking to the masses who are not ""intellectual"". It is by design that the content has been ""dumbed down""

> To whom should  propaganda be addressed? To the scientifically trained intelligentsia or to the less educated masses? 

> It must be addressed always and exclusively to the masses. 

> What the intelligentsia — or those who today unfortunately 
often go by that name — what they need is not propaganda but scientific instruction. The content of propaganda is not science  any more than the object represented in a poster is art.

> All propaganda must be popular and its intellectual level must be adjusted to the most limited intelligence among those it is addressed to. Consequently, the greater the mass it is intended to reach, the lower its purely intellectual level will have to be. 

> It is not the purpose of propaganda to provide a series of thrills with a view to pleasing these blase gentry. Its chief function is to convince the masses, whose slowness of understanding needs to be given time in order that they may absorb information; and only constant repetition will finally succeed in imprinting an idea on the memory of the crowd. 


About the persistence of the themes, the Hindu-Muslim divide, the ""other"",

> Any variation must not alter the main theme of the propaganda, but must always emphasize the same point. The slogan must, of course, be illustrated in many ways and from several angles, but in the end the stress must always be laid on the slogan itself. In this way alone can propaganda be consistent and dynamic in its effects. 

> Only by following these general lines and sticking to them steadfastly, with uniform and concise emphasis, can final success be reached. Then we shall be rewarded by the surprising and almost incredible results that such a persistent policy secures. The success of any advertisement, whether of a business or a political nature, depends on the consistency and perseverance with which it is employed.

Apart from the negatives( communalism ) , even some credible media organisations ( Theprint , Lallantop) etc. are praising his way of handling corona pandemic and also his foresightedness in making policies to make U.P a industrial powerhouse .


Is it a hogwash by Sanghi media to project Yogi as an alternative to Modi or the PR is because of the TRP and clickbaits  which yogi Adityanath gives to news channels and online portals.
Ajay bisht is not a very media friendly person and has gone to the extent of filing FIRs and jailing them, then why a section of media is bootlicking him is beyond my understanding.

I get that it often works for us because we also know our parents really love us and want the best. But I know that's not always the case for everyone and that people can have varying bad experiences for it. I know I didn't like it as a child and wish it had been less. But I wouldn't expect my mom to just not yell even when ive fucked up and shes calling me out on my shit. I thought it was a normal thing that people do now and then when upset.

So what is the Bechdel test?

The Bechdel test has three simple, unambiguous criterias:

* A film has to have at least two (named) women characters in it.

* These women characters at some point of the movie talk to each other.

* They talk about something other than men.

The test has it's inspiration (seemingly) in an 1929 essay by Virginia Woolf.

One of the larger samples tested in 2019 resulted in very few Hindi movies actually passing the same.

https://thelogicalindian.com/story-feed/awareness/bollywood-hindi-cinema-bechdel-test

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf6Amqk0gSE

I'm not even sure how regional cinema fares in this.

Television all across the country seems like it will fail the same miserably.

While the test has no assurance about the *quality* of female representation in the said movie \ work of fiction - one small incentive is, **it's observed that movies who do meet the criteria are known to perform better financially, than those who don't.**

*The Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) here, has developed a much cheaper and faster diagnostic test kit (Chitra Gene LAMP-N), which is highly confirmatory for the diagnosis of COVID-19 that has claimed over 400 lives in the country.*

*The test kit can detect the ""N Gene of SARS COV2 using reverse transcriptase loop-mediated amplification of viral nucleic acid (RT-LAMP). We are not aware of anybody else in the world doing lamp for N gene for coronavirus, Institute Director,"" Dr Asha Kishore told PTI.*

*This technology is much cheaper, faster, can check 100 per cent matching with PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) and accuracy. It will be very easy to deploy it across the country, being very cost-effective, she said. ""This will be one of the world's first few if not the first confirmatory diagnostic test for N gene of SARS-CoV-2 using the RT-LAMP technique.*

*------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*

*The test kit which is highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 N-gene can detect two regions of the gene which will ensure that the test does not fail even if one region of the viral gene undergoes mutation during its current spread,"" a press release from the institute said.*

*The institute has informed the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) about the test kit and is awaiting approval. Using Chitra Gene LAMP-N,* ***the gene detection time is 10 minutes and the sample to result time (from RNA extraction in swab to RT-LAMP detection time) will be less than two hours***\*,she said, adding 30 samples can be tested in a single batch in a single machine.\*

*The significantly lower machine waiting time will allow large number of samples to be tested each day in a single machine in multiple shifts, she said.*

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*The kit was developed by a team led by Dr Anoop Thekkuveettil, a senior Scientist of the Biomedical Technology Wing of the Institute and scientist-in-charge of the division of molecular medicine under the Department of Applied Biology, in the last three weeks.*

*The new device for LAMP testing costs around* ***Rs 2.5 lakh*** *and the test kit for two regions of N gene(including RNA extraction)* ***will be less than Rs 1000/test,*** *while the RT PCR machine costs around* ***Rs 15 lakh to Rs 40 lakh*** *and the PCR kit cost is* ***Rs 1900-2500/test.***

*The testing facility can be easily set up even in the laboratories of district hospitals with limited facilities and trained laboratory technicians,Dr Asha said.*

One of my friends who lives just beside the barricades, just called me and told that a couple of police vehicles arrived and those people were called. They were scolded heavily and were warned to not do anything like this again. The barricades were then removed.

Specifically MBA.,9,g35581,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g35581/need_help_regarding_my_career_specifically_mba/,10,"Tldr; Appeared for CAT(98.3) this year, getting rejected from colleges due to poor performance in interviews (poor social skills and acads). Questions in the bottom of the post.



So let me give a bit of a background first. I'm a 26 year old, general engineering male (GEM) candidate who has had poor past academics. Scored 88 in 10th, 66 in 12th, 60 in under graduation. In addition to that I had two year gaps in my engineering. Now before you come to any conclusion that I'm stupid or something, let me also mention that I was going through depression and did not study at all after 11th. It was only after 3rd year of engineering (2017) that I came out of it and managed to get things a little bit on track. Even getting overall 60% in UG was a huge ask but I managed that. Because 60% and 65% are some benchmarks used by colleges and recruiters.

I was ineligible for placements during my engineering and was not allowed to sit for any company because I had <60 at the time of recruitments. I managed to get to 60 only in the last exam at which time companies weren't coming for recruitment. So I wanted to go for higher education and took a year gap to study for GATE. Unfortunately I didn't do good enough and managed only 40/100. Was very down after this and didn't know what to do. At this time I had also given cat and scored 88%ile. I gave interviews for KJ Somaiya and Welingkar but wasn't selected. After talking to a lot of people I decided to go prepare for CAT one more year and give it my all.

Fast forward to CAT 2019. I scored 98.3%ile in CAT and 94%ile in XAT. Also shortlisted for IIFT. Messed up SNAP and missed the cutoff of NMIMS Mumbai by one mark. Anyway, I had applied to a whole lot of colleges, most of the top 40-45 colleges. I have already given most of the interviews, apart from a few which are most probably gonna scrap the interviews due to Corona. 

My concerns start from here. I did not manage to do good enough in interviews and group discussions. My main problem being poor social skills and stage fear. Even after a lot of practice I could only manage an average performance. Now the results are rolling out and I've realized how awful my performance in these was.

I wasn't selected for the PGDM program for IMT Ghaziabad, but was offered their Dual Country Program (which costs over 26lacs). Also got rejected by IMI New Delhi and IIM Rohtak. I have given interviews for new and baby IIMs, Nitie, MDI, IIFT and await their results.

My questions to you-
1) Should I go for IMT DCP( one year in Dubai, one year in Ghaziabad)? Points to be considered- average placement 13lpa, total fees over 26lacs, total batch size 500-600
2a)  If I go for it, how should I prepare myself before the course begins so I get an advantage in placements?
2b)  If I don't go for it, what could be my alternatives, considering getting a job is extremely tough in this environment?
3) Apart from all this, what should I do to become a better professional? What resources can I make use of?",AskIndia

At least in Maharashtra, lots of people have specifically praised UT for his efforts in tackling the situation. 
First off, I absolutely agree that his speeches are much better. His directness and communication is wonderful. But is he really walking the talk? I understand that Maharashtra has major urban cities with a huge influx of foreign and national migrants. Wouldn't he be doing a good job if regardless of that there'd be lesser cases? Maha has 3000+ cases and how can that be translated to a good job? Also the Bandra station issue. If the govt has done a good job for them, why will they want to go back?

283,How much testing is enough testing ?,11,g33qna,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g33qna/how_much_testing_is_enough_testing/,3,"  
Every time someone mentions that the number of Covid cases are low in India, you are likely to meet the ""We aren't doing enough testing"" quote.   
When you consider the data point of ""tests per million"", you will see India faring quite bad but again most of the other countries aren't dealing with a huge population crisis or even the vastness of a country like ours.   
So don't you think no matter how many tests we conduct we are anyways going to fare lowly in that metric point ? So my question is why are we complaining about the low number of tests per million and is it actually a valid data point for us to ponder over ?   
Data Source : [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?fbclid=IwAR0rPARsFSNUOELY26A42qOPNzsW3jexASVVF5uIeTWKTcRu2uPv-Ke48-0#countries](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/?fbclid=IwAR0rPARsFSNUOELY26A42qOPNzsW3jexASVVF5uIeTWKTcRu2uPv-Ke48-0#countries)   
If you notice China which is our closest in terms of population has played with their numbers to an extent where no one knows whats real or whats not. So what metric can I look at and say ""Hey the govt is not doing that bad a job"" or ""Hey, it's a shit show out there""!

A Quick recall: A new virus strain emerges out of the Wuhan Province of China last December, China declares it on Jan 1, then WHO declares it a ‘Public health Emergency’ on 30th January, then a pandemic on 11th March (A Pandemic is rapid spread of a disease amidst a large populace, within a short interval of time, spanning multiple continents).
Mass hysteria follows, as it usually does these days. Experts suggest social distancing as the best way to ensure lower spread of disease, forcing the government to finally act and ensure shutdown measures, so that our especially overwhelmed healthcare system doesn’t get even more so.
The name of this Novel (new) Coronavirus is now SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) since it being a cousin(not sibling, for that’s reserved for its mutations) of the SARS Coronavirus, a virus responsible for the 2003 SARS pandemic which spread primarily in the South Eastern Countries, and caused 770 deaths and 8000 infected people worldwide;

Here’s the case, since this is a new virus in town, we cannot possibly diagnose an infected person without testing him/her, this is NOT a seasonal fever/flu virus, this is 10 times deadlier, and has an incubation period (time it can stay alive inside human body) of 14 days, unlike the 3 days of seasonal flu.
Also, a person who is a carrier(who has the virus inside, but doesn’t fall sick) will be better able to spread the virus, compared to a sick person who gets noticed and screened out!
Best example of this being the 19 year old (way out of high-risk age groups of 60 years & above) Pizza Delivery guy, with no foreign travel history, in Delhi who tested positive, resulting in 70 families being quarantined.
Point I am trying to make here is that, that you can’t confirm Covid-19 cases, until you have enough Covid-19 tests done.
India’s share of Covid-19 tests is 0.2 for every 1000 people!
The Math: Total population of our country being 1,350,689,521, divided by 2,86,714 number of tests (according to last night’s data) would be 4710.92, which per thousand, is 0.21.
Meaning India has only conducted 0.2 tests per 1000 people, one of the lowest in the world, and the lowest in per capita.
Concurrently, the places with highest number of cases also are the ones who conducted the most number of tests, which isn’t mere coincidence.
The Propaganda: As of writing this, India has 13,425 positive cases with 446 deaths, and 1756 recovered, which is being hailed as monumental achievement, compared to other developed countries who have much more sophisticated healthcare systems than we can even imagine. This narrative being pushed by the Authorities is even bigger reason to worry than the pandemic since it is based on either them duping themselves, or the people, either way, we all lose.

The dunning Kruger: Dr RR Gangakhedkar of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said in a statement that, India is conducting 24 test for every one positive case diagnosed, which is much higher than Japan’s 11.7, Italy’s 6.7, & US’ 5.3. Quite frankly this metric escapes my understanding, because:

If we can conduct tests for 24 individuals for every single positive case, and if the growth trends in the cases follow, then we’ll be able to test each and every one of 1.3 billion citizens in a couple of weeks. Not sure there are currently enough test kits in the world, let alone in India, for pulling off such a feat.

Say out of a sample of 500 of such 24 individuals’ tests, we get one positive case(optimistically speaking), then currently we have 1,12,557 infected people who haven’t been diagnosed yet, a number which will significantly spike, by the time they are identified, let alone tested.",Coronavirus

There are offices where senior managers harass / shout at juniors, there are colleges where senior students rag juniors, there are school teachers who make fun of students who are not so good at studies and so on.

In many of the cases, I have seen that seniors harass juniors only because they were themselves harassed in the past by their own seniors. Many managers pick up the habit of shouting at juniors because they were shouted at too, when they were juniors. Do you see the problem here? - This cycle is never going to stop. One able person will harass another - this person will then harass someone else  and this will keep continuing.

So here is my request - BREAK THE CHAIN. Try to be polite to people (especially juniors around you). Try not to vent out your frustration on your maid. When you shout on her, she may not reply you, but she is definitely going to shout at someone else that day to vent out her frustration (perhaps she might shout at her kids). This will slowly start to have impact and I am hopeful people will get healthier work environments.

That’s not to say that the right is unlimited or something, there sure must be reasonable restrictions wherever applicable, the question must be how much the limits must be, that is, where should we draw the border, if at all, it’s necessary..

And also when someone voices their opinion in a large gathering, for example, especially this subreddit, it’s not practical to know what opinion offends which person. It’s simply not viable. Furthermore, censoring something one says just because it hurts someone else’s beliefs or feelings can be counterintuitive, as they’ll just be more vocal in raising their opinion.

However I suppose not everyone thinks of it in that way, and therefore I seek consensus regarding this matter, hope it helps all of us in the long run..!!",AskIndia
341,Mom being inherently biased against muslims. Help me change her views.,0,g3fogm,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g3fogm/mom_being_inherently_biased_against_muslims_help/,26,"To give it a bit of context (She stays with dad in a tier 3 city with no contact to anyone apart from work friends, I live in a tier 1 city because of job)

I recently had an argument with my Mom, about the role of muslims in the recent covid 19 spread in India. I said I'm not disagreeing that certain groups of the muslim community are solely responsible for a massive spike in infections, but the tone that you are implying means that you had a problem with muslims long before this covid infection started.

Upon hearing this, she went full defensive mode, saying muslims are responsible for all the wars with India and they are responsible for every atrocity in India. I asked how many muslims have you spoken to in your life ?  She said she knows about Pakistan and the wars and that is enough. She said they are ""abishwas jati""

Our argument heated up and now I'm here asking what do I do to change her opinion that all muslims aren't ""Pakistani"" and aren't out to destroy the world. Media doesn't portray muslim in good light and it has led to years of indoctrination with older people who have no other contact other than media. But I am not saying I am apologising for muslims. I am an atheist and consider all religions to be irrelevant, islam to be the most if I had to draw a priority chart.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  One more point, To make matters worse, when Italy was #1 in covid infections, I found she was googling, ""how many muslims are there in Italy"". It was both hilarious and sad that she drew causality vs correlation, though that argument would have failed as well as Italy is not a muslim majority country.",AskIndia

Following is the text of the tweet, verbatim:

""A Jamati died of Corona when police and doctors went to check their families they were attacked and killed, make these mullas + secular media stand in a line and shoot them dead... F**k history. They may call us Nazis who cares, life is more important than fake image."" [1]

Rangoli Chandel was followed on Twitter by over 100 thousand people. The tweet remained for everyone to see for almost a whole day. It was retweeted 1497 times and liked by over 5600 people.

Last year, in the wake of the Pulwama attack, Kangana Ranaut had said this of Shabana Azmi and Pakistan:

""The film industry is full of such anti-nationals who boost enemies' morals in many ways, but right now is the time to focus on decisive actions. Pakistan's ban is not the focus, Pakistan's destruction is."" [2]

Earlier this year, the Indian government awarded Kangana Padma Shri, the country's 4th highest civilian honor. 

Following this latest incident, if not a Padma award, it is entirely plausible that Rangoli could at least snag a BJP ticket in an upcoming election.

And they are not the only ones that have this kind of attitude to the larger population that is Hindu. There are many such Islamic congregations that operate under the same sense of autonomy from the state.

But instead of focusing on those bearded lungi-wallas we should look at the funders of such programs in India. And this is not the only country that is being funded to make its muslims more conservative and Wahabbi. Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, everyone of these countries is prey to this.

Where is all this funding coming from? Follow the money, dammit! Oldest rule in the book when you're investigating a crime.

When will Arknb and the rest -- including the so called Left Media, Wire, Print, NDTV, Hindu -- speak out against Saudi funding for Wahabbi hardline Muslim dogma in our country that has already rotted a big chunk of its population?

I was thinking about how cooking food requires daily interaction with local grocers for veggies and wanted to compare it with ordering food under lockdown. PS I can do both. 

1. Supposing delivery executives do 15orders a day, they get to interact with 30 different people. A grocer will be interacting daily with suppliers and customers and the count would be much higher.

2. You going to the grocer means interacting directly with a potential carrier(since they are interacting with more people). You meeting a delivery executive should be lower risk because the executive would at max be an intermediate carrier and and 2nd degree.

3. Todays case the employee was a a Box8 employee. I am not sure if they are as strict and vigilant as swiggy or zomato.

4. Ordering meat dishes will always be more nutritious than cooking eggs and veggies provided the cost is affordable.

5. The only con I can think of with delivery executives is that they will be driving to all parts of the city, even potential virus hotspots. You grocer will be in your locality. His suppliers might come from other parts but in this case grocer becomes 2nd degree. The suppliers and customers would also be almost same everyday while for delivery executives they would almost certainly be meeting different people every day.

My mind is biased towards ordering and so I wanted to get some counter arguments and whether my line of thinking is correct here. Currently I order only curry while I make rice/roti at home. This makes me order once or twice in two days. If you are ordering rice/roti/noodles your mileage will decrease both in cost and quantity.",Coronavirus

Now what’s left is *Community transmission* which, for some insanely bizarre reason, is still being denied by many state governments, also the fact that we don’t have enough testing kits makes me wonder who are being tested? Are people voluntarily getting tested when they show symptoms ? Which is highly unlikely unless they’re seriously ill. Because, even some people I know got cold during lockdown yet didn’t get tested.

so i called the icic bank regarding these transactions, they weren't having any details regarding these merchants, and can only forward my call after blocking my card, also even if i block my card, they cant even send me a replacement card as there is country wide lockdown in place. and now i am taking a hit because of these conditions, can anyone guide me to find who these merchants are and also is there any place where we can find who these third party merchants are so we can take some precautions regarding these type of transactions thanks, also if there isnt one, can we start a publicly accessible 3rd party merchant databse(a subreddit maybe?) and categorise them as fraudulent so it can help other indians?

Yeah Yeah i know its bad form to downplay corona virus right now.

But if the mortality rate is **0.2%** in **10 - 39** range and **0.4%** in **39-40** range then the overall mortality rate would be about **0.32 - 0.35% in under 50 range.**

Why not let people under 50 to go back to work with the obvious restrictions ....compulsory face mask and gloves ....some social distancing ....safeguards like temperature check ...companies that allow only under 50 years aged employees to work and also implement basic safeguards to be allowed to function after getting permission from authorities etc ...

I mean according to \[govt of india figures\]( [http://www.cghr.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Causes\_of\_death\_2001-03.pdf](http://www.cghr.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Causes_of_death_2001-03.pdf)/ )

In the age group 25-69, the leading causes of death in this age group are:

Cardiovascular diseases (25%), ¾

COPD, asthma, other respiratory (10.2%),

Tuberculosis (10.1%),

Malignant and other neoplasms (9%),

Symptoms signs and ill-defined conditions (5.3%),

Digestive diseases (5.1%),

Diarrhoeal diseases (5%)

Unintentional injuries: Other (4.6%),

Intentional self-harm or suicide (3%),

and Malaria (2.8%).

**India** \- **Adult mortality rate** between age 15 and 60

In 2015, **adult mortality rate** for **India** was 31.43 deaths per 100 population.

so even if we end up with 25% of the allowed adult population (0-49 years) infected with corona virus over the next 6 months ....the mortality rate is only 0.35% - which means death toll of 95,000 or 0.007% of population

Keep in mind 90% of corona virus infections are asymptomatic - so only 4-5% of the infected actually end up needing hospitalization.

Ok ....you can shoot me down now and say i am missing the point and have got it all wrong.

Amidst the pandemic scenes, I lost my campus placement. I was not interested in it anyway as I hated the course I took with all my heart(Computer Science). I took it as I didn't have much knowledge about ny future after higher secondaries and everyone said taking computer science would land me a job.

I regret this decision more than anything in my life.

I find many thing interesting, like designing stuffs, may it be posters, cars or anything. My parents and friends always used to say I have an artistic mind. I draw a lot too, good pictures also.

Then I got into photography, I take a lot of photos and still do. Have won 2-3 local photography contests. But never invested in it because I never got time to do so.

Also I never knew how to get into this photography field? I don't know anything else than taking photos and posting them on social media for meaningless likes.

By photography I mean wildlife, landscape, etc. I wish to work for any established companies as their photographer. I really wont care about the salary very much as atleast I would love what I'm doing. The thought of sitting infront if a computer just drives me crazy everyday.

I need help and advice. Do I need to complete degrees in photography to get into the field? Please help me in anyway you can.

2. Stop blaming various political factions and follow the rules while coming up with solutions for our problems just pointing them out doenst help anyone 

3. Covid 19 is dangerous and treat it so, volunteer and raise awareness amongst everyone you can reach around you about the virus and ways to stay safe ( washing hands etc ) 

4. Start with those around you, that’s how change starts 

5. Just stay safe, stay at home how much ever you can and keep yourself healthy, try to eat healthy light and meditate, do yoga, relax and spend time with your family and friends etc...

Untill he chooses a profession for himself, why not show him what careers and this world is like  in some kind of Vanity van or exploring bus?

Parental Supervision - Once the kid returns back to home from the school he faces his parents. A lot of parents are not trained to deal with kids. Still these parents advice them, scold, influence and in worst cases, abuse and beat the children. What is the need for a parental supervision after a minimum age like 10?

Colleges - A college for medical science or civil/ mechanical engineering might be necessary. But for computer engineering, what's the need for making a person attend lectures on topic he has already learnt well from Udemy and make him waste 3 years for a course in college that he can cover in just 1.5 years by himself?

Jobs - I have felt a lot of people are frustrated with their jobs. The frustrations can be can be reduced if we give them atleast a 10 day vacation to a peaceful place after every 90 days. Makes it 40 days in a year. Government Jobs have 30. Private jobs give lesser than that. In India, this is even more important as traffic and noise is too much in the cities and people crave for a heaven escape after every few weeks or months. 

Arranged Marriage - Its often difficult for those in a love marriage to keep the love intact for upto 50 years. Imagine how scary it would be for those in an arranged marriage to live together for even 10 years.

Stigma against Hookup Culture - Nations like India are famous for tinder bios like ""Not here for hookups"". Even a lot of parents of girls are against sex before marriage, compelling these girls to meet their boyfriends in secrecy. I don't know why parents do this but I have heard it is done to increase the value and sanctity of their daughter for the groom who comes as the highest bidder with the highest paying job.

This morning I woke up to the sounds of an argument between the landlord and my father. The landlord was asking us not to use one specific bathroom because it was leaking. The landlord is a pretty chill uncle, so I was surprised to hear him shouting.The argument was pretty one-sided though. So, I wake up and do my daily duties and that's when my mom comes to me to have a real talk. 

She says that we haven't paid the rent for about 8 months now and she figures that the landlord might ask us to vacate the place. She says your father hasn't been able to provide any income and shakingly admits that she's been asking relatives and people she knows money, to make ends meet.
She says that my education was supported by taking loans from relatives and that we're deep in debt, about 10 lakhs.

A little background about my family:
We're a family of three, my father moved to this city in 1995 because of his job (reputed company) and so did my mother after getting married. Things were going pretty good until 2005 when the company announced that they had to merge two branches and the branch in our city will be closed off. They were asking my father to transfer to another city, but keeping my education in mind my parents decided it's best for us to stay here, so my father resigned. My mother, a teacher, was also the earning member.
At this point in the story, my father is about 40 years old and my mother is around 33 years old and I'm 7 years old. My father lands a job in a different company, it's a different job than what he's used to, he doesn't like it. A few years later, the company is forced to close due to losses and my father was laid off. 
My father was unemployed for about a year and my mother became the primary earning member. She teaches Yoga as a home tutor. My mother handled things for a few years. Fast forward a few years, my father joins my uncle's company, a completely different job this time, and moves to a different city. It has been this way for about 7 years now, things were starting to get back on track, but my father left the job saying the bosses there suck and he can't lick their boots for a petty job. I was aware of this and I was in 4th year of my engineering at this time and I graduated a year later with a job in my hand. The job requires me to stay away from my home city and has a 1 year training period, after which I'll be considered an employee of the company. 

Cut to the question:
I was brought up without any of these circumstances affecting me, I never knew about all of this until today and that too only because the landlord came to have an argument and I happened to be awake at that time.

I really adore my mother and father, imagining how hard my mother worked to get me educated brings tears to my eyes. My mother cannot have a proper talk with father about his employment because she's afraid he might break down mentally. My dad is already very depressed (but he pretends he isn't) and also on the brink of his retirement age.I have a job now, and I'll be on the company payrolls as an employee from September.

I don't want my mother to struggle anymore, what can I do, as soon as possible to get rid of all these debts and how can I have some real talk with my father about this situation and how to handle it.",AskIndia

The virus is spread from the water droplets that come out of an infected person when they speak or cough or sneeze. So maintaining enough distance (at least 2m) from people (anyone) is important. Virus stays in air for sometime depending upon the humidity, so wearing mask is important. Virus can show its first symptoms after 5-12 days so don’t neglect social distancing ( this term hardly anyone knows in better way but it is just keeping distance from people of at least about 2m or more) at any cost. Virus can stay on different surface so maintaining personal and surrounding hygiene is important. But no govt official or media is taking an effort to educate people about all this information. Rather forcing everyone to stay at home. I understand that this will ultimately keep people away from other but what if the lockdown ends? People will still crash into others personal space and the whole thing will start all over again.

Probably because no over the top ott advertising.     

- The Night Of : About a Pakistani teen in murica who gets convicted for sexual murder. Dark stuff, and there's gritty jail / court drama.     

- The Man in high castle : What if the Axis nations won World war 2. Muricas been divided between fascist japs and Nazi's. Only watch season 1 and maybe 2. Gets dragging after.     

- The Outsider : If you liked It, It chapter 2 etc...the man who wrote them all in the first place wrote another novel in 2018. This ones grounded in reality, yet plays around with the idea of the supernatural.    

- Broadchurch :  David Tennants (Killgrave from JessicaJones) character as a hard boiled grumpy detective with a thick Brit accent (if you're used to him from JJ), and the naturally flowing whodunit story about a murdered child.     

- Sons Of Anarchy : Biker gang that goes running drugs and porn for business. Its a cool show that has family drama - and then Lots of bassassery and violence.    

- True Detective : this is definitely not an underrated show, having achieved cult popularity levels. If not seen it then its a must watch. Lots of hardboiled detective action and a strange grizzly murder


- Ash vs Evil Dead : nothing special, but fun and silly horror. Try watching a few episodes then decide. 

- Fargo: a lot of you guys probably seen this, but still needed mentioning....because its a cool show. The characters each have a lot going for them in terms of the story they add to, in a small town setting.

My father had old pass from 1st part of lockdown since new one wasn't issued due to holiday yesterday and order being withdrawn by the government. Since government is so local police claimed traveling without Lockdown #2 pass is not allowed, hence the pass. 

My father works in bank and travels with his bike to work. Despite no problem other than minor stop and check during first phase of lockdown, he was stopped today and asked for pass and documents but even then Police fined him.

He was given 2 options  seizure of hi bike or pay challan. He paid the challan of course but fact remains he had necessary travel pass, a copy of government circular allowing his movement, his bank document.

If this is how so called ""essential workers"" are harassed, how will they do their work. But I shouldn't be surprised though given even doctors have been beaten, evicted and worse.

We are searching for kickass name & which should not related to credit, it should be trendy, easy to  spell for every one country agnostic, we are creating a new platform where it takes milli seconds to  apply loan by  borrower with or without financial history Lenders able to underwrite & disburse the loan in seconds, with out human intervention. We are also changing the entire credit process  & using smart phone alternative credit data. We are using AI, ML, quantum computing in big time you’re interested in changing the future of credit.

3 billion humans cannot access basic credit services and fewer than 9% of citizens in developing economies have ever taken a loan from a financial institution.

In many economies, generations of people are governed by a dark underworld of illegal lending  a pseudo-economy ran by gangsters and fraudsters. For these 3 billion people, the idea of accessing enough credit to buy a home or start a business is a pipe dream. 

In countries rich and poor, access to credit is a fundamental cornerstone of social mobility. No matter your age, gender, language or nation, credit is the key driving force to boosting prosperity. From a newlywed couple looking to settle down and buy their first home, to an aspiring entrepreneur looking to start a small business, virtually every human on the planet depends on credit. It is the gateway to financial inclusion and ultimately financial freedom.

There are a lot of cultural and religious traditions in my family that are borrowed both from our ancestral Lucknow and from adopted Karachi. I remember celebrating the night with a mix of Hindu, Muslim and Christian friends.

I posted this last week on my Facebook, and wanted to share here with our friends from the other side. Perhaps we can see some commonality. I hope this gets posted. (reposting again

\--

The night of #15Shabaan has never been an ordinary night for a Muslim teenager. For some of us in Karachi, it is almost like Eid - new clothes, cakes and presents. For others, it is about food and sweetmeats. For almost everyone, it is about prayers and astaghfaar. For me, however, it was about firecrackers and patakhay for many many years.

Growing up in Karachi, Shab e Barat was one of those few traditions that continued to connect us with the longing of AJTFS throughout the year despite it just being a one-day event. It is celebrated every year on the night of 15th of Shabaan (neema Shabaan = Middle of Shabaan) with much fanfare, prayer, and nazars. For me, what started with firecrackers and food during my teenage years turned into a deeply spiritual practice over the years. It is customary among many Muslims to pen a letter of love and dedication to Imam-e-Zamana (a.s.) during the night of the 15th. This letter is called ""Areeza"" meaning ""Request"".

As kids, we loved writing and submitting an Areeza. I can't be sure about how Areezas are submitted elsewhere. In my family, in Karachi, we'd get a few blank Areezas from the mosque and then complete them using a qalam - a type of pen made from a cut, dried reed, used for Islamic calligraphy. The qalam would be dipped in an ink made from saffron and itr (non alcoholic scent), and then we'd write our requests, dreams, aspirations, and profess our love for the Imam e Waqt. It would be an intensely personal moment and an opportunity to share our inner most desires and fears. Once completed, these could be delivered to any tributary - a river, lake or the sea. I always felt the longing and the belief took precedence over the process and the tools, so I’ve tried to write Areeza’s throughout the year instead of just Shabaan.

10-15 years ago growing up in Nazimabad, we had only a few options. We could either go to our local mosque Noor Ul Emaan where they'd have paper Areezas for us to submit. And then the mosque volunteers would deliver these completed Areezas to Naity Jaity (Native's Jetty). The second option was to write an Areeza at home and then go to Naity Jaity ourselves. Now this second option was much fascinating for the youth as it likely involved a road trip!

I have to admit, during my teenage years, my fascination for the day and what followed was more superfluous than spiritual. I remember the day starting with fasting and helping my mother with groceries. There would be an elaborate nazar later in the day so we all looked forward to the kabab, halva and the puriz. We'd make portions of the nazar and take to the graveyard. After offering Fateha for the grandparents and other relatives, we'd distribute the nazar amongst the custodians. Back at home, we would break our fasts, and perform amaal for the day. The lucky ones got to sneak out and celebrate with firecrackers and patakhay.

In our particular home, we had a mix of Lucknow and Karachi traditions. After the evening Nazar, we’d start our amaal and stay up for the whole night. After midnight, we complete the amaal and start writing our Areezas. My mother would make dough balls for us to bury our Areezas in. I remember she telling me the reason why we use dough balls was because the fish from the Naity Jaity would carry the Areezas off to AJTFS. The place used to be packed - people from all walks of life, vendors and small groups from all over. Everyone converging on this auspicious night to share their deepest desires, aspirations and fears with the Imam e Waqt (a.s). It would be a surreal moment to reckon with. In my family, we were always to spend the night in Ibadaat rather than being swept in the culture of firecrackers that seemed to have taken root. I remember stopping on our way back at Saabri Nihari Saddar and having Nihari early morning just as crimson would start to engulf the horizon.

There is much debate today about the necessity of faith and religion. No matter which lens you view Shab e Baraat through, it is a testament that one’s belief is at the core of our individual survival. All of us, many of us, while we may speak different languages, follow different religions, we are almost always, expressing the same faith in a power beyond us.

And whether we believe in this or not, we acknowledge deep down, that there are things beyond your control.

And that is what binds us all together. #EidMubarak",Non-Political

I took in two stray kittens, they mostly stay indoors but sometimes go outside. A few months ago I was feeding them boiled chicken and one of their teeth touched my finger, I wasn't sure if I bled but I went to the hospital, told them what happened. They gave me 4 shots on days 0,3,7 and 28 and asked me to get a booster a year later. Today while I was about to go out, one of them bit me on the leg through pants. I was wearing thick jeans at the time but I did feel her teeth, I went outside but I had a bit of realization 10 minutes in and decided to check my leg. I couldn't find a wound, I dont believe she penetrated through the clothes and it didnt seem like that strong of a bite either. But I still washed it with soap and water about 20 minutes after I got the bite and then I went to the hospital. The doctor there didn't even know what days they were supposed to administer the doses and kept confusing me but then he started writing the 4 dose vaccine again and I told him I already took it 2 months ago. Then he said I don't need anything and simply recommended me a tetanus shot. I took the tetanus shot but I'm growing increasingly paranoid. It's been almost 2 hours since that bite. I've checked on Google in some cases the wound is so tiny you need a magnifying glass to see it. This guy didn't even ask me where I was bitten, if I was bitten, if I bled, as soon as he heard cat bite he'd started writing. I don't know if I should trust him, I'm kind of a paranoid person. I live in a small town so there's no private hospitals here, there's private clinics but they don't open till 5 pm. I don't know, what do I do?",AskIndia

I know everyone is unsure of the future at this point but I thought that I could get some advice and opinions on this topic. I have a flight booked with United Airlines to leave the USA on August 31st, arriving in Delhi, and was planning to backpack through Ladakh, Himachal, and Uttarkhand. United Airline's policy now is saying that you must choose to change your flight by April 30th, the latest, in order to have change fees waived, and they will issue a travel voucher. Change fees are about $350. If I go ahead and cancel the flight to receive a the travel voucher (no refunds) and things seem safe to travel again in September, re-booking the same flight will cost $300 extra, as the cost of the flight has increased. 

My other option is to rebook for January and head to South India instead, although it would be disappointing since I had my Himalayas trip planned far in advance and I am very excited. Being in isolation with just me and my dog for the past month, thinking about my upcoming trip to India has kept me going. September and January are the only months in the year that I can travel because of work.

719,A Question to all Legit Suppliers and Manufacturers from India,13,g1mwan,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g1mwan/a_question_to_all_legit_suppliers_and/,7,"Hi all, I've been looking for direct suppliers and manufacturers for N95 masks from India particularly 3M masks. I heard that they were cheap if I source from this country and I've seen some very promising suppliers and manufacturers from India's B2B marketplaces with good prices. To cut the story short, I've got over 50 suppliers blowing my phone and email but my problem is 90% of them do not offer safe payment methods such as PayPal Goods and Services or Escrow (kind of like Alibaba's Trade Assurance).

All of them also seem to have the same method, send photos of the masks (some are really just recycled photos taken from elsewhere) and they do not even offer sample/trial orders (orders with very less quantity to check the item and verify authenticity). Some do, but minimum order is like 500-1000pcs which is definitely not a trial order. Somehow, I got a feeling that all these guys are part of one big elaborate scam. Asking to wire money through T/T, WU, MG etc. and PayPal Family & Friends. Some have websites but they are really very sketchy and badly designed.

We cannot buy from China either as their masks cost more than $5 dollars a piece even with a MOQ of 1000pcs. But we all know that 3M masks do not even reach a retail price of $2. Another reason why we can't buy from China is because the moment you sell more than the SRP, our government will arrest you and your goods get confiscated and donated. A close friend of mine owns a bunch of retail stores hence, why we are looking for extremely cheap 3M masks. Plus, we have contacts with a lot of private buyers and companies who want to buy masks at very high quantities.

So to sum it all up, there are no n95 masks here because no one wants to sell because the government won't allow us to sell it over the SRP (anti price-gouging), and we can't just rely on donations either.

So a question to all you legit suppliers and manufacturers out there, am I just asking to get screwed? What are your suggestions? How do you handle transactions from foreign buyers?",AskIndia

- Nation's fighting well, thanks to you folk's sacrifice. ""We the people of India"" means exactly this [Starting till 4 minutes in speech].
- India started screening for COVID before the first case. At 100 cases, we started isolation. At 500 cases, we did a lockdown for 21 days [6 minutes in speech]
- It's unfair to compare with other countries. However, if we compare, India is at a relatively good standing (by around _25 to 30 times_). [8 minutes in speech]. The lockdown and social distancing was expensive but worth it. Still, _the rate of spread is alarming_ [10 minutes in speech].
- Citizens, state governments, bodies have suggested and some have _already_ implemented an extension to lockdown. **Lockdown has been extended till 3rd May 2020** (under the _same circumstances and conditions_). [12 minutes in speech].
- We have to avoid the spread of COVID in regions. Death due to this must be even more worrisome. _We must stay vigilant with current and emerging hotspots_. New hotspots will bring problems. 
    - **Stronger constraints and implementation of lockdown till 20th April 2020**. Essential services and operations can resume for areas of lower risks (under conditions for going out). _If any traces of COVID, the lockdown shall be reimposed_. [16 minutes in speech].
- _A guideline shall be released by tomorrow_ (_15th April 2020_). Major steps are taken to _help the poor and needy_. The government has helped them through various funds, specially farmers. There are efforts being made for helping farmers, supply chain is being improved [18 minutes in speech]
- We've already organized over 1L hospital beds and 600+ COVID hospitals. Scientists are encouraged to help in these times of crisis [20 minutes in speech].

### Help needed in 7 areas 
The public is encouraged to focus on the following areas [start 22 minutes in speech]:

1. _Extra care of the elderly_ in the house
2. **Obey lockdown**. Use **homemade** masks.
3. Improve immunity.
4. Download ""Aarogya Setu"" [mobile app](https://www.mygov.in/aarogya-setu-app/) and encourage others to download it.
5. Help the poor and needy
6. Don't terminate employment of workers under you
7. Respect the front line workers (police, healthcare professionals, etc.)

**Please follow the above till 3 May 2020** [till 24 minutes in speech].

**Tl; dr**

In today’s speech announcing the extension of India’s national lockdown till 3rd May, 2020 the country’s Prime Minister requested citizens to [**download the** ***Aarogya Setu*** **application**](https://www.news18.com/news/tech/pm-modi-says-aarogya-setu-app-is-critical-in-the-fight-against-covid-here-is-how-it-works-2576857.html). Unfortunately, the application remains a privacy minefield and it does not adhere to principles of minimisation, strict purpose limitation, transparency and accountability. IFF’s Working Paper, analyses the application, highlights how it is inconsistent with the right to privacy, is conceivably a risk toward a permanent system of mass surveillance, and suggests clear recommendations to arrest these risks.

**Background**

On April 13, 2020 IFF released its working paper called,  “[***Privacy Prescriptions for technology interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view)”. A significant portion of this working paper is dedicated to the proliferation of experimental contact tracing applications not just in India but across the world. India has also launched its own contact tracing solution called *Aarogya Setu*.

IFF’s working paper was alert to this and Chapters 5-7 devote significant space in studying the emergent government and non-government practices, standard setting processes and first principles in the space. Chapter 7 of the paper studies three specific models of contact tracing including the Singapore Government’s *Trace Together* application, MIT’s *Private Kit: Safe Paths* initiative, and *Aarogya Setu*.

**What is Contact Tracing?**

According to the WHO, contact tracing occurs in three steps namely (a) contact identification; (b) contact listing; and (c) contact follow up. In particular, contact tracing is a pillar which helps public health officials in containing and the pace of transmission of the virus. This pace of transmission is measured by the unit R0 (R naught) which essentially connotes the number of people an infected person can spread the disease onto.

Contact tracing has traditionally been administered through the use of on ground personnel and volunteer armies. However, with the ubiquity of smartphones, which collect vast troves of personal information, governments across the world believe surveillance can aid with rapid contact tracing. But owing to the peculiarities of the coronavirus, authorities across the world are beginning to realise the limited efficacy associated with respect to location surveillance (both with cell tower data and with GPS signals).   


As a result governments and other groups have either released or are developing smartphone apps that use Bluetooth beacons or GPS signals to log instances wherein a user’s device comes in contact with another user’s device. When a user of the app is detected to have Covid-19, contact tracing officers might be able to use the app to identify their close contacts in the prior days or weeks.  


**What’s the Risk?**   


With the creation of such systems, come new risks of institutionalisation of mass surveillance. Critically, India lacks a comprehensive data protection law, outdated surveillance and interception laws, or any meaningful proposals for meaningful reform. In domains like disaster relief,  most apps which are purported as ‘contact tracing’ technologies, they often devolve into systems of movement control and lockdown enforcement.

A lot of technology solutions with no demonstrable scientific value to the national response can be passed off as being in the public interest. It leads to poor deployment of public resources and also makes it difficult for crisis responders to discern between “snake oil” and quality technology products. These risks are exacerbated in technology markets since there are no adequate checks and balances in development phases which ensure quality.

Such systems inadvertently discriminate against regions which have fewer concentrations of smartphones. Specifically, it can lead to harmful outcomes for people residing in economically weaker areas. In countries public health systems are already creaking under the looming threat of capacity deficits. If such systems wrongly urge people to pre-emptively take tests then there is a risk that public health systems may be overwhelmed prematurely.

It may also exacerbate the risks associated with the harvesting of personal data like health information, and also see the creation of new privacy invasive systems.

**How to prevent these risks?**

Such systems must consider embedding the following principles among others:

1. The usage of these applications should be voluntary
2. All data should always be stored locally on people’s devices
3. This data must be encrypted
4. No Government can access it at a later point, so must ensure nothing is centralised in a server
5. Governments must appreciate that any data from location information, to proximity confirmations, to health status, to whether they have been placed in isolation is sensitive personal information.
6. Privacy by design is more than just assurances that phone numbers are not recorded, all data is encrypted, pseudonymisation is deployed or that the use of the app is “voluntary” and based on consent. Most of these protections have known techniques of circumvention.  


Therefore, we need to adhere to two principles:

1. Strict limits  (in terms of collection and duration )every step of the way; and
2. Comprehensive evidence-based justifications every step of the way

**Aarogya Setu compares unfavourably to Singapore and MIT**

https://preview.redd.it/0zw655ssbss41.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=488f2ca51d6a194e6858495a346eb42e072a2d5b

Consider the following aspects.

**Is this for disease control or for other purposes?**

In other countries, health authorities are leading the efforts to respond to COVID-19. For example, in Singapore only its health ministry can use these systems or have access to any limited data/interaction which is shared with them. European authorities are making similar commitments. They assure citizens that law enforcement personnel will not have access to these systems or the data therein.

In India, multiple committees have been set up in the context of *Aarogya Setu* or other technology responses to the coronavirus. But formal notifications nor press reports have any reference to major involvement of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Instead health authorities are being tertiary institutional players.

To protect people’s right to privacy, countries (including Singapore) say that contact tracing will be used strictly for disease control and cannot be used to enforce lockdowns or quarantines. ***Aarogya Setu*** **retains the flexibility to do just that, or to ensure comply legal orders and so on**.

**Minimisation? What Minimisation?**

1. Singapore monitors people’s interactions through Bluetooth beacons, MIT does it through GPS, and **then there’s India which uses both**.
2. Other apps just collect one data point which is subsequently replaced with a scrubbed device identifier. India’s Aarogya Setu **collects multiple data points** for personal and sensitive personal information which increases privacy risks.

**No Transparency leads to discretion**

The only information we have of the app is its frontend and its rather pedestrian Terms of Service (TOS) and Privacy Policy. Other projects release as much information as possible in pursuit of transparency. This may include an accompanying manifesto, technical specifications, general FAQs, and even its source code. Not only does *Aarogya Setu* go the opposite route but it also prohibits external good faith actors from reverse engineering the application for further scrutiny, information security and other related research which help facilitate stability.

Similarly, the app is capable of wrongfully identifying people as COVID-19 positive as admitted in the app’s Terms of Service. We ask in our report the question in our paper, does this mean people can get diagnosed as being infected with coronavirus based on an application rather than an actual medical test? Similarly, does this mean that a false positive entails that I cannot use public transport and go to work or leave the city to visit friends? This evokes imagery of the Chinese model of surveillance during COVID-19 and we have highlighted these risks as well in the report.

**No Accountability and No Auditability**

The Government has a blanket liability limitation clause inserted into its service agreements and privacy policies. This means citizens cannot hold the Government accountable or seek judicial remedy should they wish to ensure the Government’s processes are compliant with the right to privacy.

Second, the Government talks about certain obligations to delete certain personal data from its application after a 30 day time period. However, as expected this claim comes with enough exceptions which facilitate government discretion. This is compounded with the fact that both researchers and individual users cannot actually check if the Government has deleted people’s personal information and has no means of transparently auditing what the app is doing in the backend.

**Risk of Permanence and Compromises to Autonomy | The Anonymisation Gambit**

Finally, the app runs very palpable risks of either expanding in scope or becoming a permanent surveillance architecture. People are describing the current times as 9/11 on steroids. And with 9/11 we saw the creation and proliferation of mass interception capabilities for some governments. The Government has failed to provide any defined period by when it intends to review, delete and ultimately destroy its systems and data which is collected under the *Aarogya Setu* project. Second, there are already reports which confirm that this server is being linked with other government datasets. Such linking increases risks of permanent systems of mass surveillance.

Finally, the Government says that the TOS and Privacy Policy do not apply in any capacity to what falls under the category of anonymised data sets. The government cannot just say something is anonymised and aggregated so no longer personally identifiable without showing its citizens how it is ensuring this. This level of transparency is a minimum, since the vulnerability of anonymised datasets to people’s informational privacy and security is well documented in information security communities. Considering the risk of these anonymised data sets becoming permanent systems of data analysis, the Government has to keep itself accountable to public scrutiny.

**Conclusion**

IFF has addressed all of these challenges and many more when undertaking its case studies, and the paper eventually sets out a series of 17 recommendations to ensure people’s informational privacy are protected even in these uncertain times, wherein Indian authorities are viewing civil liberties as an afterthought.

This car turned 5 today, and what a great companion it has been. We have other cars in the family, but this one remains my favorite, and even my dad loves it. It is super-nimble and comfortable, in fact, more comfortable than my Hyundai Xcent (I bought it in 2018 because it runs on CNG and is very cheap to run). The Nano seats in the front were designed for people who are 6 footers, and everyone gets surprised to be able to stretch their legs.

Looks like new after 5 years

The Nano is amongst the most famous Indian engineering products globally. Yes, a lot of folks in India shun the car because it ""makes them feel cheap"" and they'd rather buy a 3 lakh rupee bike or an expensive car on EMI to look cool. But when I did my MBA abroad, the Nano was the only Indian case study that was taught. People abroad love to investigate the innovations in the Nano, and at the same time look at it as a marketing failure because it did not highlight the ""aspirational value"" associated with owning a car in India.

5 years of ownership experience has been great. Tata service in the area I live in is superb- better than Hyundai and Maruti. They take the car from our house for service and deliver it back at no extra cost.

The Nano is a marvel, not only because of its price but because of the space it offers and the extremely innovative packaging. You won't feel tired even after full-day drives, which is not the case in most small cars. The AC is superb, the fuel efficiency is around 14 in the city and over 20 on highways.

Some people say that the ""nano is unsafe and I'd rather travel in an Uber than be seen driving one"". I have never been in an accident in one, but I don't exceed 60-70kph on any road, and try being as careful a driver as the road allows. Airbags would have been great

I wish Tata takes the lessons of the Nano forward and brings out more innovative products. Sadly, in India, innovation does not sell. People are more concerned about looking rich.

If you're looking for an inexpensive used car, the Nano is a great option. It costs around a lakh for models produced after 2015, and you will get a reliable, reasonably comfortable car that is a joy to drive on city roads. Avoid the cars made before 2012, because they had niggling issues. Thanks for reading.",Non-Political

Wanted to discuss the situation regarding the extension today, it was a basic need for a country like ours for sure, just imagine if community spread starts in India it will dwarf the problems the whole world is looking at now. We see teasers of this even today in Surat etc., but they are just sparks and it will be a storm if it spreads.

Having said that one thing I do feel we are neglecting is the economical part, which might lead to bigger problems than the flu itself. Even with the lockdown lifted labor that is gone won’t be instantly back, in fact I expect labor still in place will head for their homes, this will be just the 1st step. We are unable to immediately revive even our essential manufacturing facilities and this delay will lead to shortages increasing panic across the country. This leads to a self-feeding issue i.e. the problems compounding due to not stopping a small problem leading to bigger and bigger ones. I am in Punjab, from my window I can see the fields ripe for harvest, it was to be ramping up last week with full flow tomorrow, it is looking very unlikely right now because of the lack of labor. After the lifting of lockdown if it takes weeks upon weeks to get back to production, the shortages will become more and more dire and in the following months we will see the fire that the tiny sparks in Surat, Mumbai etc. are trying to show bringing us face to face with fate in an abyss.

The main reason for writing this isn’t to point out our bad future or blame someone it is to suggest some basic resources we haven’t utilized till now, some ideas. Starting from the labor or our poorer brethren heading back, it is because they feel outsiders in the place they are, unable to receive help or the unknown scaring them for the future, we solve this we start our work on solving our non-flu problems. Right now, at a time of limited resources we are using the bare minimums to seek out the needy (Police delivering food), we need to reverse this the needy need to come to the source (Pyasa Kuey pe aye, Kua pyase ke pass nai), of course that is basically breaking the lockdown so what we need is something very accessible that wont lead to a breaking of curfew yet accessible enough for the needy to access. The two things I can think of are police stations and post offices, every neighborhood in our country has one of these nearby. We should implement distribution of resources to the needy by them approaching the nearest one and collecting the resource, this can be further closed down to the needy of station “32” area, “row 1” can send 1 person from 8 to 830 and “row 2” from 9 to 930 so on. If some needy are left they use the phone numbers and the resources are delivered by night. This can also work for the harvest we need the labor willing to work to assemble at the local station maintaining social distance at a specific hour and the ones who need labor can sign them up or even not have a face to face have the labor register and the hirer registering at different times and the nearest ones matching are informed. This can be implemented in a manner which minimizes the number of people outside at the same time, put money into hands needing them, if somebody is not hired then the info is already there and we utilize MNREGA and make sure everyone who needs work has income.

We need to utilize the vast call center resources that our country has, the call centers should be hired for a limited time by the government to answer calls and make calls so every citizen is in touch and knowledgeable about their duties and fulfillment of their needs, this has 3 benefits, calling can be done from home, phones have a very deep reach into the interior needy areas, income start for the callers. This should be done against a basic citizen database so info can added next to every name, if they are good it says good, if the have a need the need is mentioned, then by level of severity the issues are handled by the required organization.

Running out of room so lastly, the biggest resource we are not utilizing is our citizens at home, they can be put to use in many ways, Ill give one example. Our medical sector is facing a huge need of PPE equipment, if you look at what this equipment it is something that can be made at home with resources we already have (Standards might not be same but something is more than nothing.) The lack of visors for example, how many of us have helmets at home simply remove the glass at front attach elastic and we have one visor ready, if the government puts out a request we as a community can respond to what we can and what we make can be collected from houses and reach where needed. We have so many professions essential sitting at home, today Punjab got 1000 tests, that is a bit less than the testing required, we need every chemist in the country to have the information needed to make the test if they can prepare it they do and government can collect. 

These ideas might be the worst you have heard but what I am trying to get to is in a stereotype Indians are portrayed as IT nerds, call center land or brainy we need to be utilizing these for basic ideas. Only lockdown wont save us. I would ask you try reach to whoever you can to try and spread the ideas. I will try and get my idea to someone in authority, if you want please write your solutions and post on Facebook twitter or whatever you have, I am tired of reading our issues everyday in newspapers hopefully in a few days newspapers will be carrying information that can be utilized to solve a problem we are facing.

We can do that or do nothing, “May the Planet heal and life thrive”

768,India And The Pandemic,3,g1nekp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g1nekp/india_and_the_pandemic/,8,"Health like never before has become the primary Global agenda today. While the virus is spreading at speed of jet, the world is still clueless on how to control it, especially the west. As of now over 1.9 million Covid 19 cases have been reported and more than half of them have been recorded across Europe and US only. With the Chinese having controlled the virus spread and swinging back to motion, all eyes are now on India's combat in the South Asian region. India being the second most populous country with highest population density is always vulnerable to pandemics of large scale such as Covid 19. Considering the population India has, it is interesting to see that it has managed to keep the numbers to a low.

PREEMPTIVE MEASURES

India was swift enough to place preventive measures early sighting the seriousness of situation and was more apt prepared than any other major country. The US, China, Italy, Spain and UK recorded community transmission within 20 days after first detected case , while its been over 60 days of our first case and we are still in Stage 2 and in very well control of the situation.

India was fast enough to take rapid actions to limit abroad travels by suspending visas, thermal screening and quarantining of incoming travellers. Also India started closing its border, issued advisories to travellers, evacuated its citizens from Iran, China,Italy and Japan. And all of these was done much before WHO declared Covid 19 as a Pandemic. Taking a leaf out of China's aggressive strategy, India has imposed a nationwide 40 day Lockdown .Clear communication has been setup between states and centre government for imposing and controlling the Lockdown. A very strong surveillance system is spread across all the districts with Rapid Response Teams active in all of them. Hotspots are being identified to minimise spread.

While every needed step is taken to prevent the Stage 3 transmission but knowing that our expenditure on health is very low ,the facilities and infrastructure of our public health system are extremely strained , one cannot ignore the potential danger that community transfer possesses.

PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM

A preparedness plan has to address all levels of cure in terms of infrastructure , equipment, testing facilities and human resource in both public and private sector. We have the largest population that is least equipped to cope with crisis like Covid 19. Health expenditure across India today are fastest growing component of rural family debt. India spends only 1.3% of its GDP on Public Healthcare Systems which is by far lower than global average of 5.4%. We have to realise that there is an immediate need to increase it in coming years.

""Hope for the best and Prepare for the worst"". It is good to see that preparation for combating community transfer have already started. Government has scaled up its health infrastructure to handle evolving situation. Ventilators, PPEs and other necessary medical devices have been ordered in mass and to be supplied at earliest. Much like Spain plans are put forward to acquire Private Hospitals and Laboratories under public control for limited period of time. Also the government has ensured that the treatment for Covid 19 will be covered under Ayushman Bharat scheme, but in case the severity of the pandemic rises then the government would also have to look at large,differentiated and uncovered middle class too.

RISE OF LEADER NATION

Most of the big guns have been hit hard and are now burdened heavily with their own situations. With the WHO been found wanting many times, the world is lacking a United Leadership at the moment. United efforts are need of the hour and our Prime Minister Narendra Modi is leading the charge for coordinated efforts to minimise threat of this deadly virus.

India holded first high level SAARC meeting since 2014. India's decision to hold the conference despite open reservations against talking to Pakistan reflects Befitting attitude of a Leader nation that has risen above billateral issues to engage all nation to think of larger regional good. Even when a global crisis looms large, India has depicted that the SAARC spirit should be sustained and the organisational platform can be used to foster regional cooperation.

Inida's Pharmaceutical industry meets over 50% of Global demand and with Hydroxychloroquine showing early trends of success , this makes India a key player in the coming time. PM Modi has stressed for need for a Humanitarian and not just economic based approach to globalisation. India's efforts are being recognised and applauded globally

ROAD AHEAD

A friend of mine had quoted ""We have focussed long on being the one with button that kills millions than having the one that saves lives"". We never have done enough to prepare for future infectious outbreaks. Its high time to realise that we should make united efforts in providing Primary Healthcare and Education to everyone.

There has to be more transparency and an open environment for sharing and discussion. Once things get to normal, we need to come to accountability of this suffering, had the new strain been reported earlier by China the world would have got more time to tackle it.

While the trials of candidate vaccine are already underway,which is amazing and encouraging but it will still take time for vaccine and treatments to be studied and scaled up. So in meantime we all need to do our part and STAY HOME.",Post link Directly

Now the Challenge:--> Discuss any religious topic with your family member. Ask a lot of why? and Share your outcomes. 

\----------------------------------

Full Story

\----------------------------------

A thought occurred in my mind.

We know Rama as a ""Maryada Purushottam"" and ""Ideal Person"". So What did he do So that we can call him a ideal Person.I searched my mind and only able to figure out some like left kingdom, left his wife as a king etc.

I couldn't find any other thing.

So I went and have a discussion with my Mother. I told her ""what did Rama do? And Why should I follow him? There are a lot of people like Gandhiji, Bhagat Singh etc and these people did this kind of work.That's why someone should follow these people. So What about Rama?""

My mother told me ""Rama Left the kingdom, left his wife as a king and he is a god who took birth as a human for us. So we should workshop him. And don't ask these type of question about religion and to religious people(i.e priest)?"".

 I quietly asked ""Why should not I asked question about religion and to priests?"" Mother told me ""Because they are always right we should do as they told us to.""

I told her ""if I got infected from Corona and A priest say that God chose me for his work. Now spread that virus and do your duty"" So that will be right?

She thought for a second then said ""No, you should ask question.""

So I told her ""Maa, There are a lot of people who think that whatever their religious leader saying is right. They neither ask question nor actually think about that. They just do whatever their religious man is saying. And These people belongs to every religious Hindu, Muslim, Sikh etc.. And These Tablighi Jamaat are also such people""

As Soon as I put up the Muslim reference(and other fact about them) in our discussion She said ""*So Now you have became anti-national also"".*

I was like WTF. **I live in a remote village. On daily basis my mother watch a little news on these shit channels. You can imagine the kind of damage Godi media have done that ""A Mother is calling his son Anti-National"".**

To Godi Media: I will do what ever in my control to stop you. and If any person from Godi Media is reading this ""Shame On you"".

Ok Done.

Discuss any religious topic with your family member, ask a lot of why?  And share your thought.",Non-Political

I hope you're all safe during the lockdown. 

I'm your typical engineer who's pursuing a degree in one of the core branches. And though I am not miserable at quantitative aptitude, I just feel I am not a cut out for doing that. I am literally scrapping through my engineering degree copying one assignment at a time and cheating my way through tests. I feel like an imposter and think of myself as a failure who's about to become an engineer without even knowing the basic concepts. 

My only passions are writing and somewhat web designing. I have monetized both of my passions and earn some spare change through that. Recently, I have been exploring journalism a lot and I feel that a media house is where I belong. I simply love the idea of giving a voice to people who are yearning to be heard. I want to cover stories, make documentaries, and write news features from the remotest places on this planet. 

Now, the problem is, due to my non-journalism background, no media house has ever reverted back to my emails asking for apprenticeship. I don't know how to switch careers and I need help and this pandemic doesn't make it any easier. Here are my main queries:

1. What do media companies (specially digital publications like VICE, The Wire etc) look for in an apprentice? 
2. How to build a journalism portfolio without having any formal training in it? 
3. How do I approach these companies? Should I slide inro HR's DMs (LinkedIn) or should I mail on their careers email? 
4. How to make this move a permanent one? Is an MA in journalism required? Should I move out of country to study?

How can people live life without taking vacation ever,thinking ten times of cost of eating at restaurant and working till retirement?And still people breed?And as far i have seen,parents spend their whole life in making their child stand on his own feet.Parents own  life is badly fucked up.And the children repeat this step.Even after this,India has large no of old age homes and 90% elders work to survive.It means parents don't save(or can't save) for their own future.And child is struggling for  making sufficient money.Most of the time people talk about money problems.Parents depend on child for care in old age and child is fucked up in earning sufficient money for his family and if he marries,then for his wife and child.Where does this go?

Wouldn't ""no sufficient money=no child planning "" will be helpful.Cost of raising a child is 67.4 lakh,approx.Why government just don't pass a bill saying people earning less than X amount can't have a child.Obviously, for few days public will be furious but atleast,India future will get better,isn't?

Read details below",7,g141sz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g141sz/economists_of_rindia_can_you_give_your_views_or/,2,"Recently , I was reading an article on inflation and unemployment

>A.W. Phillips was one of the first economists to present compelling evidence of the inverse relationship between unemployment and wage inflation. Phillips studied the relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of wages in the United Kingdom over a period of almost a full century (1861-1957), and he discovered that the latter could be explained by (a) the level of unemployment and (b) the rate of change of unemployment.

>Phillips hypothesized that when demand for labor is high and there are few unemployed workers, employers can be expected to bid wages up quite rapidly. However, when demand for labor is low, and unemployment is high, workers are reluctant to accept lower wages than the prevailing rate, and as a result, wage rates fall very slowly.

>A second factor that affects wage rate changes is the rate of change in unemployment. If business is booming, employers will bid more vigorously for workers, which means that demand for labor is increasing at a fast pace (i.e., percentage unemployment is decreasing rapidly), than they would if the demand for labor were either not increasing (e.g., percentage unemployment is unchanging) or only increasing at a slow pace.

Does this mean the current government's quest for low inflation is indirectly leading to unemployment going up .

Low inflation means companies and investors have no initiative to invest . However during times of inflation , investors look for places to invest their money in since it will keep on losing its  value if it kept ideal .

During Congress years of 2004-2014 , high inflation also most probably lead to increased consumer spending and expenditure. Since a large sector of Indian economy is dependent on internal consumption , it experienced significant growth due to it 


The reserve bank of India has been also extremely focused on fighting inflation . Many people are saying that this obsession with inflation is causing them to keep interest rates too high , as a result of which private companies have no initiative to borrow loans for new ventures


>As these examples of hyperinflation show, states have a powerful incentive to keep price rises in check. For the past century in the U.S., the approach has been to manage inflation using monetary policy. To do so, the Federal Reserve (the U.S. central bank) relies on the relationship between inflation and interest rates. If interest rates are low, companies and individuals can borrow cheaply to start a business, earn a degree, hire new workers, or buy a shiny new boat. In other words, low rates encourage spending and investing, which generally stoke inflation in turn.By raising interest rates, central banks can put a damper on these rampaging animal spirits

You have no business breeding if you enjoyed this massive piece of trash.  In fact, your internet privileges should be taken away, since you morons have rated this fecal matter 9.3 on IMDB.  Do you chumps actually understand what ""acting"" means?  Making huge bulgy eyes and exaggerated reactions to any goddamn event, and having the camera move to your face to show your reaction to everything does NOT qualify as good film-making or acting.  Those saas/bahu TV serials have better acting and facial expressions! Crazy feats by the hero are a staple of almost all action movies - but this movie took it to a complete nonsensical extreme (one guy stopping an entire goddamn statue from tipping over).
I won't even go into the ""start molesting the girl and she'll like you"" romance subplot - I've seen fucking Hentai's that have better character relationships.

Honestly, the frustrating thing is that India is capable of releasing great cinema.  Company by RGV is my favorite Indian movie.  Black Friday, Satya, Ab Tak Chappan, Taare Zameen Par, Delhi Belly, Kahaani are all excellent.  There are plenty others which are at the very least competent - Sarkar 1/2, Sarfarosh, etc...

But this Baahubali shit... man..I'm dead serious when I say if the Indian public thinks that this is fine film-making - we deserve to be wiped out of existence.  It isn't a poverty thing either - I was at a theatre in the US - and plenty of absolute retards were clapping and whooping at the shitty dialogue and the ""romance"".  

I grew up in India watching plenty of cheesy 80s/90s Hindi movies - and enjoyed many as a kid, and plenty as an adult.  But Baahubali was so far above and beyond in sheer stupidity that I weep for our civilization.  This movie is going to be held up as a ""shining"" example of Indian cinema... I feel like stabbing people in their faces.

------
EDIT - since I see people making ""you like chocolate and I like vanilla ice cream"" type posts, I'll preempt those here - 

Reasonable people can have different tastes. However that logic only extends to a certain point. No matter how ""artistic"" you think your spray of diarrhea on your toilet is, it will never be ""better"" than a painting like the Mona Lisa. You are simply wrong and unreasonable if you find your shit to be ""better"" art than the Mona Lisa. Some things are objectively worse than others - period. Baahubali in this case is objectively inferior to almost any other movie ever made.

852,Foreigner Impression: My Favorite Thing About India,12,53vioc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/53vioc/foreigner_impression_my_favorite_thing_about_india/,183,"I recently wrapped up a trip to India (I did the Golden Triangle). My favorite thing about my trip to India was how much it made me appreciate that I don't live in India. 

Before arriving in Delhi I did research and booked a two-night hotel stay ahead of time. Upon arrival I went to an 'official' taxi stand at the Delhi airport to get a ride to the hotel. It was 02:00 and my traveling partner and I were both exhausted from the flight. The taxi driver began driving us to our hotel and then gave us a story about how the roads were closed due to political violence. He told us that unfortunately he wouldn't be able to bring us to our hotel due to the road closures. He then brought us to a 'tourism agency' and a desk agent proceeded to make fake phone calls to his friend who pretended to be working at my real hotel. The desk agent told me they would have to make alternative sleeping arrangements for us for our own safety. After making me feel bad and then demanding payment for making him wait (what a nice guy, right?), my taxi driver brought us to a very seedy hotel. The front desk agents at the hotel refused to give us wifi access lest we figure out that we had been abducted/kidnapped. Unfortunately, I was too tired and unaware of my surroundings to challenge or question the scam. Looking back I realize that we were essentially abducted. The next day my hotel emailed me and asked why we never showed up. When I emailed them back to explain what happened they weren't even surprised. This was just the first day.

The rest of my trip was a relentless series of scams and harassments. I never got scammed again thanks to the wonderful education I received on the first night. But I have to say, it was exhausting and made it difficult to simply walk around. Small packs of Indian teen males dressed like homoerotic cowboys droned around treating me like I was fucking Justin Bieber. Many of them asking me for selfies and then taking pictures of me anyway when I declined their request.

Then we took a train to Agra. I had become intimate with the filth, dirt and pollution in Delhi up to this point. The massive piles of trash, dirt and feces; ungodly smells that have permanently permeated my subconscience. I spent the next few hours on the train watching no less than a thousand of people taking shits on the train tracks. The train-shitting will be permanently etched into my memory for all of time.

Around this time I came down with travelers diarrhea. Most likely from some shit that I ate because of improper food handling. Or maybe I got it from the shit I drank because the water in India is all contaminated. Regardless of how I got it, I spent the next 5 days shackled to my hotel room because I couldn't stop explosively shitting out diarrhea. 

Finally I began to feel better and decided to go see the Taj Mahal. After dodging scam attempts, getting harassed and heckled I eventually made it. After taking some videos of the Taj Mahal with my camera I soon found myself surrounded by a pack of men, including an Army officer with a machine gun. They then berated me for taking pictures and videos of the Taj while hundreds of other people around us took pictures and videos with their cameras and phones. I asked the men and the army officer why hundreds of other people were allowed to film. The answer to this question will probably accompany me to my grave. I was then harassed by these same men who wouldn't leave me alone until I checked my camera into a locker. 

It was at this point that I decided that I would be engaging in masochism if I continued my trip. So I left.

My takeaways:
+ The filth, dirt, garbage, feces and smell are such a massive problem that they can't be ignored. Egypt, Palestine and Jordan seemed like a swiss mountain retreat compared to the stuff I saw in India. + The scamming, harassing and heckling was non-stop and exhausting. + I have never seen such a wanton disregard/outright hostility of people toward their own environment. + The expression: ""Don't shit where you eat"" never resonated with me more than when I was walking around India. + It amazed me that India is on the same planet as the other countries around the world that I've visited.

In short: thank you India for giving me perspective and appreciation for the things I have in my life. For the loving people who don't judge me or tell me who I can/cannot marry. For the people who don't judge me for not believing in God. For the faucet that gives me clean drinking water and the food that nourishes my body. Thank you India, for reminding me that I live in a place where people even have the luxury to care about the planet we all share together. For all of you struggling to make a better India, I send you my love and wish you the best of luck in the struggle. For those of you who continue the status quo without any consideration or thought: may god have mercy on your soul.

Dear Friends, 

This is a very important message if you care about the unity, peace and progress of India. 

In the last few weeks, we've seen that media, especially the English Language channels and newspapers are continuously harping about things like 'rising intolerance' and making a big issue out of some isolated incidents which happened in UP and Karnataka. If you are foreign investor looking to set up some industry in India, you would certainly get scared looking at the evening English news shows (NDTV, India Today etc) and morning English newspapers  (Indian Express, ToI etc).


But on the ground, we the common people of the country don't see any such intolerance or hate crimes happening.  We see that people of all castes, creeds and religions are going about their normal lives without any obstruction from anybody. Since Modi government got elected, no changes have been made to any laws related to social matters. Then why is the media 'manufacturing' these stories of so called intolerance? Why is the media laying the blame at Modi's doorsteps for crimes that are taking place in states ruled by 'secular' parties like Cong (Kar) and SP (UP) ? Why would channels and papers like NDTV, India Today , ToI, IE etc cause damage to the image of India just for benefitting anti-Modi parties like Cong,CPI(M) etc? Here's why :


Pronoy Roy (head of NDTV) is married to Radhika Roy. Radhika Roy is the sister of Brinda Karat of CPI(M). Brinda Karat is the wife of Prakash Karat , ex-head of CPI(M)


Barkha Dutt of NDTV is currently married to Haseeb Ahmed Drabu, who is a PDP politician from J&K


Nidhi Razdan of NDTV is live-in partner of Omar Abdullah, former CM of J&K


Sonia Singh of NDTV is married to RPN Singh of Cong and a former minister in UPA govt


Rajdeep Sardesai of India Today (formerly CNN-IBN and NDTV before that) is married to Sagarika Ghose who is currently with ToI and ET Now (formerly CNN-IBN). Sagarika Ghose is the daughter of Bhaskar Ghose, who was appointed as Director General of Doordarshan by Cong govt. Bhaskar Ghose has been accused of doing financial favours to NDTV, his son in law's employer.


Vishnu Som of NDTV is the son of Himachal Som. Himachal Som was then made Indian ambassador to 'Italy' by Cong govt. Reba Som is the mother of Vishnu Som. She is an 'eminent intellectual'. She has written books about Nehru and Congress.


Vikram Chandra is an anchor and the CEO of NDTV. He has been accused of money laundering to the tune of 5500 Cr for P Chidambaram from the 2G scam loot (link here : http://www.manushi.in/articles.php?articleId=1749#.VjHTuH4rLIU  )


Sitaram Yechuri is the current head of CPI(M). He is married to Seema Chishti. Seema Chishti is the resident editor of Indian Express , Delhi.


Sanjay Jha is the spokesperson of Cong and a frequent face on TV. Rajkamal Jha is his cousin. Rajkamal is the Managing Editor of Indian Express.


I hope now you realise why English language media paints Modi/BJP/RSS as a monster.  I would encourage you to google and verify the correctness of each of these facts. Forward this message to every Indian so that the real evil face of media is exposed. Our media is wolf in sheep's clothes.

859,A Bengali woman's guide for Bengali girls on how to choose men.,5,56x8y9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/56x8y9/a_bengali_womans_guide_for_bengali_girls_on_how/,75,"Let me try to answer this question in a slightly longish way. First a little bit about myself. I am a Bengali woman based out of Mumbai and am a mother of 2 lovely kids. My husband too is a Bengali. What I will detail below are what I’ve heard and gathered over the years from my Bengali girl friends, colleagues, relatives and acquaintances over the course of many years.

First a few points about marriage itself. One, marriage isn’t just about two individuals finding heart to heart connect. Humans are social animals and its said that no individual is an island. So deciding to marry any person isn’t just about the person and you, it’s also about your family and his family (at the very least) and also about the wider society itself. Taking the view that marriage is only about two individuals is selfish and such marriages die a natural death, with deleterious consequences to both parties, in the course of time.

Allow me first to digress a bit and try and answer as to what makes Bengali women so wanted and desirable. First, they are truly equal to males what with their parents never having discriminated against them in their upbringing on the basis of their gender. Second, they are well qualified and with their smarts, poise and confidence get well earning jobs. Third, they are considered “hot” and therefore desirable by other Indian men. Fourth, they are trusting and liberal, which is often taken advantage off, and last but not the least, they are money foolish. It is a proverb that a fool and his money are soon separated and Bengalis fit this description to a T. When Bengali women fall for cheats such as below its but natural that their dumbed down money instincts, coupled with their liberalism, can be a poisonous concoction that leads to financial ruin. Look no further than what has allegedly been done to Bengali women just on the fake promise of marriage. 'Tax man' duped women of Rs70 lakh on matrimonial sites - Times of India. If Bengalis can lose money merely on the promise of marriage it doesn’t take a Sherlock Holmes do infer that the Bengali and her money will soon be parted in a closer relationship, such as marriage, if she isn’t careful.

**How do Bengali non-Bengali marriages impact Bengali families economically?**

It is often seen that Bengali girls, despite being given a liberal upbringing and good education, choose to marry partners from downright misogynistic and patriarchal cultures. These are the people with the problems of female foeticide in their societies. When a Bengali girl marries a non-Bengali, the entire past, present and future life of the Bengalis are impacted. Bengali society by spending money on the education of their daughters and thereby creating an economically independent entity are in a way subsidizing non-Bengali societies, who in a economic sense “profited” by commiting female foeticide. Secondly in the present, the entire resources generated by the Bengali girl and her savings are appropriated and used by the non-Bengali society. Thirdly, after the death of her parents, it is seen that the Bengali girl invariably litigates for paternal property. Note that Punjabis and Banias, who have a strong Delhi connection have better access to lawyers who can get justice at the Supreme Court. As an example, gentle reader, you are referred to the following Supreme Court judgment (Civil Appeal No 4646 of 2006)

(edit : link removed; just search in google for Civil Appeal No 4646 of 2006)

So in a way the Bengali father is working his entire life for the betterment of non-Bengali society.


**Dowry**

A point that is often missed is that love marriage is not a dowry free marriage. The dowry system in non-Bengali cultures is systemic and deeply entrenched in different aspects of their cultures. Bengalis often think that since there is no upfront demand of money the marriage is dowry free. However that is not so. In the long run the Bengali father will end up giving more dowry over the lifetime of his daughter’s marriage. In addition after his death his son will be expected to take over and continue giving the dowry. How does this system work. Non-Bengali cultures ask for expensive gifts like gold, diamonds, even cash, clothes (for all relatives) for various ceremonies after marriage. Thus there will be ceremonies after say 30 days of marriage, 45 days of marriage, 6 months of marriage, 1 year of marriage, which have no equivalent in Bengali culture in which the girl’s father is expected to give gifts. Often times these are done on the pretext of pujas. In addition marriage ceremonies are often elaborate and the non-Bengali side often demands that Bengali families pony up money for that. This can be upto 4–5 lakhs conservatively. In addition since non-Bengalis usually have lots of relatives then it’s expected that gifts be given to a large number of relatives, maybe upto 50 people. One can easily calculate expenditure for that. On atleast two specific occasions, i.e. baby showers and right after birth of children, the girls parents are expected to send gifts and money to the non-Bengali inlaws and relatives. Expenditure for the baby shower is atleast 1 to 1 and half lakhs and after birth of each child it is expected that Bengali parents will send gifts to inlaws, son-in-law and baby, the expenditure for which is not less than 2–3 lakhs for each child. In addition non-Bengali families expect gifts on the occasions of festivals such as Diwali etc. If the Bengali father refuses then obviously the working Bengali girl will pay these from her savings. This is dowry plain and simple. Similarly non-Bengalis give gifts to their sisters on these occasions and the Bengali girls often times spend their and their Bengali parents’ life savings on the marriage ceremonies of their husband’s sisters. This too is dowry as money is being extorted from Bengalis on the relationship formed through marriage. The Indian courts accept all of the above examples as valid instances of dowry harassment.

**Diet**

One point that is not given enough importance in Bengali girl non-Bengali men marriages is the issue of diet. I advise gentle readers to read the following National Geographic article on diet and how the diet of our ancestors is key to our sustained health and wellness.

The Evolution of Diet

If Bengali girl is put in a situation where she can’t eat fish and meat then it will impact her health. How one may ask? See meat/fish is harder to digest so it stays in the system longer and makes people feel fuller longer. Therefore people don’t binge eat processed foods like chips, biscuits etc thereby keeping weight in control. It is often seen that Bengali girls moving to a vegetarian diet after marriage put on weight as they have to eat more to feel full. This gives rise to various health problems such as hypertension, diabetes and even cancer. So the best food for an ethnic Bengali is the diet of her ancestors, that is maach, bhaat, pulses and gourds.

Ok, getting back to the main question at hand. I will classify non-Bengali men based on their backgrounds and try and provide guidance on the the question asked.

***North Indian Men, mainly from UP, Bihar, MP (mainly Hindi speakers)***

These people are parochial and don’t have much love for either Bengalis or Bengali culture. In fact due to linguistic pride they positively feel superior to Bengalis and seek to put them down. These are also the folks with dowry/dowry death/domestic violence problems in their own community. See the case of north Indian political leader of anti-corruption party based out of Delhi married to Bengali wife.

I might also add here almost everyone in this category has a relative or two in politics. Now, dear Bengali lass, you may see this as an advantage. However think about the following. Social interactions demand give and take. I know of a Bengali lady MBA, from a premier institute in India, who married her classmate who belongs to this category of people. Both husband and wife are in corporate jobs. However the non-Bengali man has politicians as relatives and they have pressured the couple to be their benami for illegally acquired wealth. This is because at the husband’s family level it was felt that this couple was best placed to hide/invest their wealth as they could explain that it was theirs. However this didn’t fly with the income tax department and last checked there were prosecutions against the couple for wealth beyond their means. Also note that most politics in India, at all levels, is accompanied by court cases etc. I know of Bengali lady, a software engineer working in a well known Indian company, who was forced to stand surety in court for a relative of her non-Bengali husband of this category. This person then absconded from court proceedings and the poor Bengali girl had to face the ignominy of being jailed for few days for having stood false surety.

**North India Hindu Punjabis/North India Banias/Gujrati Patels/Jains/Marwaris**

This is a category different from the one above. They don’t display any overt hatred towards Bengalis or Bengali people but they are very money minded. Since they don’t display any overt hatred Bengali girls are often drawn towards these people. However the reasons why these people want to approach Bengali girls is not always love and altruism. Recall that Bengalis are well educated with good jobs. A good many of the above category of boys have startup dreams nowadays and expect their wives (and their wives parents) to seed fund their ideas and for the Bengali wife to earn while they take risks. That only 1 out of 7 start ups succeed is a cold statistic that is true in India as it is true in the rest of the world. Bengalis being liberal minded, especially Bengali parents with only one daughter may be more likely to pony up money for the non Bengali son-in-law’s startup dreams. The point here is that if a Bengali father has a net worth of 1 crore he may be convinced to give upto 50 lakhs for his non Bengali son-in-law’s startup dreams. Were the same non Bengali son-in-law married inside his community, his caste father-in-law would only have given him 25 lakhs (out of his networth of 10 crores). As stated earlier Bengalis are fools with respect to money and girls should see if there are any warning signs that they will ever be exploited.

I might also point out that today a substantial number of Bengali girls get married to the boys of this category. So large is the trend that were these boys Muslims, the Hindutvadis would have labeled it as love jihad. However Bengalis don’t think in this way.

Lastly, there is the important point of diet. A vast majority of these folks are vegetarian.

The other major point is that in these families the finances of the family members is often controlled by an elder male, usually the father-in-law or even the father-in-law’s elder brother. Everybody is expected to turn over the finances to the control of this gentleman. The sons do so and their wives, irrespective of background are also expected to do the same.

One special point I’ve noticed amongst this set is that Bengali girls with business qualifications such as MBA, CA, CS, ACMA, Actuary are in high demand and affairs with non-Bengali men start during the course of professional study itself.

**Special point**

One thing that is seen with most north Indian men is that they project more that what they are, be it in terms of wealth, accomplishment, family status and most importantly earning capacity. They may have some business/companies also but their earnings will be minimal and they are actually looking to live off the earnings of the wife. Most Bengalis are from service class and take things at face value and get fooled. See the case of north Indian political leader of anti-corruption party based out of Delhi married to Bengali wife.

One another point is the celebration of Holi in North Indian families. Usually the ladies stay in the house and the relatives come to celebrate at home. This is a festival wherein touching and hugging may be to the extent that the non-North Indian wife may feel uncomfortable especially if the male persons doing so belong to a different generation.

A third point is that people of this category often engage in side businesses to supplement their income. They expect their wives also to engage and be part of this business. This could be anything like Amway, selling insurance, stocks, mutual funds, or even home made crafts, drawings, soaps etc. Bengali women who often have some training in arts and crafts, which their Bengali families trained them in as a hobby, may be particularly vulnerable and under pressure at non Bengali households to commercialize their knowledge. So Bengali woman will be expected to earn in office, do their full quota of housework and child rearing and also engage in side business of selling Amway or crafts. It is not that the incomes from these are fabulous. Yes, everyone desires extra money and income. However Bengalis have solved the problem differently by working hard to get good education so that they can get better paying jobs and not have to do this side income business.

**Muslim boys, both Bengali and non-Bengali.**

A certain set (not all) of these types actually consider it their bounden duty to convert Kafir girls to Islam. That’s their only objective. Be wary of this type. Typically their misogyny will give them away.

**Tam Brahms (also most other South Indian Brahmins)**

This set is most akin to Bengalis, in terms of love for culture, literature, music etc. barring diet. However be prepared to bear with an overbearing attitude and a “I-m-so-superior” attitude and a “preferred” way to do things. If you can tolerate this then go ahead. In addition these people, and in fact most non-Bengali men, are far more money minded then Bengali men.

**Non Brahmin South Indians**

There’s nothing in particular to not recommend them. However a lot of these people are quite flexible with their faith. At the time of marriage the boy may be Hindu but after some time he may convert to Christianity. Also most of these people have one branch of their family which is Christian. I know of a Bengali lady lecturer who married a Telugu gentleman. At the time of marriage the gentleman was Hindu. About 10 years ago the gentleman converted to Christianity and became a Christian preacher. His Bengali wife also became a Christian and co preacher and they now have their own ministry in Andhra.

**Keralite men**

With a heavy dose of communism, these people may share some of the liberal ideals of the Bengali. However be warned about chettan’s love for beef parotta and liquor and that he and his Malayali male friends will love to gather for binge drinking sessions. A last point about South Indian men, and it applies across caste and religion, is that they are thrifty spenders and the Bengali’s innate liberalism may be appalled at the penny pinching ways of these people.

**Marathi men**

I stay in Mumbai and have been to my fair share of Marathi boy, Bengali girl marriages. In 100% percent of the cases I’ve noticed that the marriage was conducted only as per Marathi culture. While in marriages with other non-Bengalis a few or even the entire marriage happens as per Bengali customs, in Marathi-Bengali marriages the marriage is always as per Marathi culture. Marathis don’t really have any strong opinions about Bengalis but are vigilant about their culture at their times.

**Foreigners/White men.**

White men, may not be able to differentiate between Bengali women and non-Bengali women but there are often some wrong reasons as to why foreign men look for Indian women. Chief among them is that they want to marry somebody to whom they can always feel superior. This is an inbuilt and unconscious racism in their psyche. The Bengali or Indian wife is essentially a maid, albeit a well treated one.



Since the writing of this answer I’ve been asked if there are other observations that I’d like to share on Bengali non-Bengali marriages.

So in no particular order of things here are some of my observations.

About 50% of the Bengali girls who come from WB or north eastern states to metros such as Delhi-NCR/Mumbai/Bangalore marry non Bengalis. About 10% of Bengali boys too do so.
99.99% of Bengali women whose fathers migrated to the above mentioned metros and who have had a substantial period of stay outside WB marry non-Bengalis. About 25% of Bengali men also do so.
In the past 5 years or so about 25% to 35% of Bengali girls in WB too are married to non-Bengali men.
In the first year after marriage Bengali girls married to non-Bengalis will invariably turn up at the local Durga Puja pandal, non-Bengali hubby in tow for sindur khela. This decreases as time passes and later it’s all about Karwa Chauth and Diwali and Durga Puja is given a pass.

Bengali girls marrying Bengalis, irrespective of place of origin, are generally past 30 years of age. The men are usually 35+. Both sides may have had a broken affair or two. The Bengali women is more likely to have had an affair with a non-Bengali man.

Bengali girls marrying non-Bengalis, irrespective of place of origin, are in the age group of 21–27, i.e. their prime age. In almost all cases in this category the Bengali lady has a baby within 1 to 1 and a half year of marriage.
Bengali ladies adjust or rather compromise far more in marriages with non-Bengalis than they do in marriages with Bengali males, to the point of submission. Often times this results in substantial loss of independence, especially with respect to food habits and finance. This no wonder is a cause of delight to her non-Bengali in-laws who extol her virtues as the ideal daughter-in-law. One doesn’t know the reason for this behaviour. Perhaps there’s a guilty complex that since they took the decision on their own they must bear the cross of their decision owing to their high levels of conscientiousness.

Bengali girls, ostensibly feminist, take their freedom and liberalism to be license to choose a non Bengali husband where they have LESS freedom post marriage. It is often seen that the marriage turns abusive and the Bengali girl and her parents are left holding the bab(ies) quite liberally.

It is also seen that often when Bengalis marry their daughters to non-Bengalis they forget all principles and gift expensive items such as cars to the non-Bengali son-in-law, something that no Bengali son-in-law or Bengali family would even have demanded.


Some people wrote in to say that. but Ma’am, my non-Bengali guy is awesome and has all the qualities that I’m looking for. He’s rich, well educated, handsome, funny, caring and has great earning potential. So what if he’s non-Bengali? Also all of what you describe is in general and my guy doesn’t quite seem to fit your description. To those here’s my counter argument. Consider that you’re buying a flat or a house. You find this fabulous property, at the right price, at the right location. The construction also seems OK to you and the builder is promising to deliver your project on time. So you go on the internet and find that lo and behold this builder’s earlier projects are all mired in controversy. In one place he’s delivered behind schedule and in another his walls have seepage. So promptly you drop your plans of buying the flat at the builder’s current project, even though in the present case the builder has every intention of performing good construction and delivering the project on time. So you can draw parallels to your marriage from this example.

**Conclusion**

People often ask as to why Bengali girls want to marry non-Bengalis. If I were to hazard a guess it would be one, low self-esteem and two, they don’t like their fathers’ personalities. The Bengali gentleman is too mild-mannered for his own good and women and daughters need a good father figure. If the father were stricter then they would have had more caste pride. In addition Bengali fathers don’t stand up to their wives and are not assertive with them which is why daughters don’t consider them to be “strong”.

Nevertheless, gentle Bengali lass, if even after reading this you insist on marrying a non-Bengali man insist on two things.

The marriage ceremony will be entirely by the Bengali method. i.e you will marry in a saree and not a lehenga or something and groom will wear a dhuti and topor provided as per custom by your family.
You will never, repeat never, keep fasts for misogynistic and patriarchal festivals like “Karwa Chauth”. Say that your best wishes are always with your husband and even if you didn’t keep a fast he would do well and have a long life.
Don’t have a baby before 3 years of marriage. If the yellow matter hits the roof then you can make a less painful exit.

Insist on cooking and eating non-vegetarian food at home, even if your non-Bengali husband doesn’t eat it. This is good for your health and if your husband and his family care for your health they will not oppose it.
Before you get married to non-Bengali family think whether your daughter will be given the same opportunities, education, environment and freedom to choose, especially her life partner, as you have been given in your Bengali household.

Ensure that you get married in the place where your parents live or in your home town in West Bengal. This is particularly important if god forbidding you are tomorrow forced to litigate with your husband’s family to enforce your rights. It is often seen that non-Bengali families getting married to Bengalis arrange for marriages at their hometowns in remote parts of North India. Think of this. If you ever need to litigate then it will be very difficult to enforce your rights from that remote town. Heck, you may not be able to even engage a local advocate. In addition the husband’s family may frustrate your attempts at justice by filing transfer petitions to delay and force you to surrender.

Don’t engage in any side income business, such as Amway etc after marriage, just because your non-Bengali husband etc is doing it. Bengalis got better education to get better paying jobs so that they don’t have to do this. Bengalis earn money to save, spend on their children’s education and for travel. If your non-Bengali partner is not appreciative of this then perhaps you need to choose a different person. That said if you have a genuine business idea then by all means jump full fledged into it.

[Link to the wikicable on Modi.](http://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06MUMBAI1986_a.html)

>Modi, Law-and-Order and Hindutva 
 
-------------------------------- 
 
10. (C) Modi has successfully cultivated the image of a 
no-nonsense, law-and order politician among Gujarat voters. 
This image of Modi as a strong, decisive leader is what his BJP 
supporters hope will help him establish a foothold at the 
national level. 
 
11. (C) Modi's role in the 2002 bloodshed continues to divide 
Gujaratis and Indians in general.  While he remains repugnant to 
large numbers of people, particularly Muslims, human rights 
activists and educated urbanites with liberal or leftist 
leanings, many in the Hindu majority view his actions in 2002 
favorably.  Negative attitudes towards Muslims remain firmly 
anchored among Gujarati Hindus.  Many feel that they, and not 
the Muslim minority, are the true second class citizens of 
India.  Muslims often ""stepped out of line,"" prior to 2002, we 
often hear, demanding and receiving exceptional treatment by 
politicians who felt the need to placate them on the basis of 
perceived injustices carried out by the Hindu majority.  That 
changed when Modi came into power in 2002, they say.  While no 
one will openly condone the bloodshed of 2002, many Gujarati 
Hindus feel that Modi ""put Muslims into their place.""  The BJP 
continues to echo these themes in its national political stance, 
especially over issues such as Hajj subsidies, the Muslim civil 
code, the singing of Vande Mataram, or other such religiously 
sensitive concerns. 
 
12. (C) Modi continues to support a Hindutva agenda in the 
state, with the recent passage of amendments to the state's 
anti-conversion law (ref A) being seen as a concession to his 
supporters on the Hindu right.  Both supporters and critics of 
Modi confirm that the state government continues to use 
administrative tools to marginalize and ghettoize the Muslim 
minority. 
 
13. (C) At the same time, most interlocutors tell us that Modi 
cannot gain anything more by openly pursuing an aggressive 
Hindutva agenda.  He already has the backing of those who 
applaud his firm stand against Muslims, and he risks alienating 
swing voters in Gujarat by being too openly communal.  Modi 
understands that, outside of Gujarat, his role in the 2002 riots 
has damaged both his reputation and that of the state.  He also 
realizes that outbreaks of communal violence in Gujarat will 
harm both his chances in the state and nationally, and hence he 
has given law enforcement agencies clear instructions to act 
swiftly if violence breaks out, we have been told.  Several 
interlocutors cited Modi's rapid reaction to the communal 
rioting in Vadodara in May (ref B) as proof of his new strategy. 
 Modi allowed federal army troops to establish order, and he 
even visited hospitalized Muslim victims of the riots in an 
attempt to portray himself as a leader of all Gujaratis.

We've seen large public gatherings hosted by BJP themselves (MP govt topple victory party, gaumutra party, ayodhya CM event and many others). On top of that, the failure of central government to plan for anything is shocking. They now have the perfect opportunity to blame Muslims as the originator and spreader an of COVID-19.

It doesn’t matter if its Hindu King, who wasn’t elected into power, signed the state over to India.

The muslim PEOPLE of Kashmir DO NOT and NEVER HAVE wanted to be part of India.

India is colonising Kashmir the same away the British Colonial Government had once enslaved India for centuries. India has become its own worst nightmare.

“We are protecting you from indignity.” said the Europeans while enslaving the Africans.

“We are protecting you from hunger.” said the French while starving the Vietnamese.

“We are protecting you from terrorism.” said the Indians while terrorising the Kashmiris.

Communication down. Hospitals, schools, and markets CLOSED. State leaders under house arrest. This is what the Kurdish people of Northern Syria experienced when ISIS rolled over into their towns with their guns.

All of this transpiring around the holy occasion of Eid. This shows just how “concerned” India is about the welfare of the Kashmiri muslims. Imagine India under siege during Diwali.

India has become a tyrannical regime.  


**EDIT**: For the dim in need of clarification as if it wasn't deafeningly obvious already: I'm for Kashimir's independence from India, Pakistan, and any other foreign element. Kashmir only belongs to the Kashmiris. To deny their right is to commit an **unforgivable** war crime. Kashmir's fate post its independence shouldn't be anyone's concern but of the Kashmiris.

This post will be mainly for youngsters who are confused about their future and less for people who are already successful or are already regretting after doing the mistake.


I am a doc. I cleared all the competitive exams and everything back and now enjoy a good wage and respect from society. I have been observing my other classmates who didn't chose engineering medical or CA route and thought of following their passion in all other fields. And I have also spent some time seeing where they are now. Heck even had talk with some.

Your parents are completely justified and correct in forcing you to chose these 2-3 fields. You may be thinking WHAT. But the reality is quite shocking.

These fields are stable and pay handsomely. You don't need to be too great in them, especially medical, to earn a handsome salary. Heck even in engineering, if you are from IIT, average package is 8-10lpa. That will increase and get an IIM and you are set for 18-20lpa on AVERAGE (Do a little hard work and you are set for more. Do bit more and you can even go outside India) . I myself earn around 30lpa. It's not billion but it's average money and enough to survive I guess.

Now I have seen my humanities and other commerce friends with their degrees. By God unless you are at top, forget about even 8lpa. They are having ALOT of difficulties earning good money. They are basically living of their parents money. Some of the good looking ones go in sales and so they get advantage of their genetic looks there.

But overall I have seen that these professions give stability. One of my friend is a musician and he is STRUGGLING HARD. Guy thought he could earn by being an instrumentalist. He forgot he need to only be good at singing but he isn't. 

One is doing mass media and last I heard she was trying to change course due to saturation.

Ofc engineering is having plenty of failiure but getting a NIT/IIT is a bit hard work but a sureshot way of stability and success in life.

That's why your parents aren't against your passion but they are intelligent and prudent and know that money matters in the end and these are the only ways to get them!

Not saying that you can't earn in other profession but get ready to have a TOUGH AND HORRIBLE life especially at start if you do those other professions.",Non-Political

However, this has still led to a lot of misconceptions about the Muslims of India, our culture, our religious views, politics, etc. by both our fellow Indians and the broader Muslim community.

/r/IndianMuslims serves to give the Muslims of India as well as the diaspora of Indian Muslims on Reddit, a platform to discuss the many political and social issues affecting our community. We also aim to explore the Islamic culture of India through art, history, architecture, film, music, food, poetry, and other important factors that make us who we are in relation to India and the wider Muslim world.

All are welcomed, whether you are Muslim or non-Muslim, Indian or non-Indian. It doesn’t matter where you live, whether in India, Middle East/Gulf countries, North America, etc., you are all welcomed to be a part of our community.

Hope to see you all soon!

Roadkill is not even a problem for Indian animals. It is the fireworks that scare the living hell out of them. 

The amount of fuel you burn to drive that car of yours is worth nothing. It is only when you buy fireworks that you are ""literally burning your money."" 

Stop this nonsense. Diwali comes once a year, folks. Celebrate it the way you want to. If you're really concerned about the environment, give up your car for one month and take the bus or the train for a change. 

Let people choose how they want to celebrate this festival. I, like all those who possess a little bit of common sense, am aware that Diwali is a festival of light and not that of sound and smoke but I believe that saying no to fireworks is not how you should celebrate. 

You do you, fellas. Crackers or not, this Diwali be happy, safe and sane. :)

931,Are the students of Jamia Millia Islamia really interested in secularism? Evidence points to the contrary.,2,ee2yz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ee2yz1/are_the_students_of_jamia_millia_islamia_really/,23,"Over the past week or so, we have seen violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) across many states. The one that was probably reported the most was the protest by Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) students. News channels like NDTV and India Today repeatedly reported how the police used excessive force against “peaceful” protesters. We were told that the students were opposed to the omission of Muslims from the CAA and sought to fight against it to “save” Indian democracy and “secularism”.

&#x200B;

While going through posts on social media, I came across an interesting piece of information - that JMI reserved 50% of its seats for Muslims. Not having too much faith in the accuracy of social media posts, I wanted to verify if this was really the case. Because if it were, it would clearly show that JMI was anything but secular. And so I started to go through their official websites: www.jmi.ac.in and www.jmicoe.in. What I learnt during my research astounded me. I knew that Muslim institutions gave preferential treatment to Muslims over non-Muslims but I never expected it to be this bad. My article relies solely on the documents and information available on these two official websites. No third parties, no hearsay. All the sources and links are listed at the end of this article.

  
To begin with, the claim that 50% seats in JMI are reserved for Muslims is absolutely true. The following text has been taken from Page 30 of the 2018-19 prospectus of JMI. (as can be seen in the attached image)

  
5.1  
(i) 30% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for Muslim applicants.  
(ii) 10% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for Women applicants who are Muslims.  
(iii) 10% of the total number of seats in each Program shall be earmarked for “Other Backward Classes” (OBCs) and Scheduled Tribes who are Muslims.  
Note: If seats remain vacant in any program from amongst the 10% of the total number of seats earmarked as per 5.1 (ii) and (iii) above, such vacant seats shall stand transferred to the category 5.1(i),i.e., Muslim applicants.

  
In other words, 30% seats for Muslim applicants + 10% for Muslim women + 10% for Muslim OBC. If there are any vacant seats from the Muslim women or Muslim OBC category, then those seats would be transferred to other Muslim applicants. So there would AT LEAST 50% seats for Muslims in JMI. Why do I say at least 50%? Well, apart from the 50% reservation for Muslims, there’s 5% reservation for Persons with Disabilities (or PwD). This reservation for PwDs is not limited Muslims only but since the selection of students would be done by the JMI staff, they could opt for Muslims over PwDs from other religions. And on top of that, there’s 5% reservation for “Internal (Jamia) students” i.e. students of Jamia who have passed their qualifying examination (X or XII) from Jamia Schools. And given that the same 50% reservation policy for Muslims exists in Jamia schools, the students from this category could all be Muslims. So on the whole, there could be up to a maximum of 60% Muslims from the reserved categories.

  
But wait, it gets a lot worse!! There could be far more than 60% Muslims in a program / course. How? Because Muslims can also get admissions in the General category !!! In other words, 50% seats are reserved for Muslims only i.e. only Muslims can opt for these seats. Of the 5% reserved seats for PwDs, Muslims can be given preference. And 5% reservation for internal jamia students would almost certainly be all Muslims. On top of that, there would be Muslim applicants in the General category i.e. Muslims students who opt for admissions not via reservation but in the general category. So in the end, the percentage of Muslim students could be way more than 60%.

  
To find out the exact proportion of Muslim students, one would require the list of all admissions in a particular program / course. I did find the list of all admissions for the year 2019-20 but since those lists display only the registration number of the students and not their name and religion, it cannot be used to determine the exact number of Muslim students. However I did find the list of graduated students for the year 2018. This list mentions the name of the candidates in addition to the registration number. Here’s what I found:

  
a. In B.Tech Computer Engineering, 37 of the 62 graduates are Muslims i.e. 59%.  
b. In B.Tech Electronics and Communication Engineering, 40 of the 62 graduates are Muslims i.e. 64%.  
c. In B.Tech Mechanical Engineering, 43 of the 65 graduates are Muslims i.e. 66%.  
d. In B.Tech Civil Engineering, 51 of the 65 graduates are Muslims i.e. 78%.

  
Assuming that the proportion of students in admission and graduation would be more-or-less the same, this data not only confirmed my suspicions that the percentage of Muslim students in various courses would be least 60% but went on to show that it may be as high as 80%. I analysed the data for these four streams of engineering. There are several other courses but I did not spend my time analysing each and every single one. For those who are interested to dig deeper, relevant links can be found at the end of this article. 

  
I then looked into scholarships i.e. what percentage of the total number of students who received scholarships were Muslims. Alumni Association of Jamia Millia Islamia (AAJMI) is tasked with providing scholarships for JMI students. I found the list of the selected candidates for the current year.

  
In the first list, out of the 325 selected candidates, 303 are Muslims; which is 93% !!  And in the second list, 96 out of the 99 candidates are Muslims i.e. 97%. In other words, of all the students who received scholarship in 2019, approximately 95% were Muslims.

  
This data conclusively proves that an overwhelming majority of students at JMI are Muslims and that Muslims are given preferential treatment. I wondered if the same pattern holds true for the positions of deans and Heads of Department (HODs). And predictably enough, JMI does not disappoint !!

  
Of the 37 heads of various departments, 32 are Muslim i.e. 86%. And when it comes to the Deans of faculties, 8 of the 9 are Muslim = 89% !! (Annual Report 2017-18)

  
Finally, I went through the list of Chancellors and Vice-Chancellors of JMI. By now, I’m sure you can guess what I would have found. Of the 11 Chancellors since 1920, not one is a non-Muslim. And the same holds true for VCs. Not one of the 15 Vice Chancellors since 1920 is a non-Muslim.

  
So in the end, *60-80% of the students, 95% of scholarship recipients, 86% of the HODs, approximately 90% of the Deans of faculties*, and all the past & present Chancellors & Vice Chancellors of JMI are Muslims !! And yet, they claim to fight for ""secularism"" !!!

  
Ask yourself these simple questions:  
1. How serious can the students of such a university be about “secularism”?  
2. Should we as a nation pay any heed to their demands given their shameless hypocrisy?  
3. If they indeed were such strong believers in the idea of secularism then wouldn’t they start by secularising their own university first?  
4. Do the students and professors of this university have a moral right to oppose ANY act on the grounds of secularism?

  
For any unbiased reader, this article conclusively proves that the JMI is not interested in secularism in the least. Then why are they protesting CAA? In my opinion, the reasons are:  
1. Supreme Court’s decision in favour of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya.  
2. Belief that Muslims must be loyal to fellow Muslims over the country i.e. Muslim Ummah (or Ummat).  
3. Rightly / wrongly concluding that NRC will be bad.

  
It is also very interesting how leftists / liberals and Muslims have learnt the subtle art of appropriating the Constitution to suit their own agenda. Everybody has heard the accusation that the CAA violates Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. One can find many Muslims, and non-Muslims, repeating the same crap. It is however very interesting that Muslims are demanding equality and cite Article 14 as the justification. Well, if they are so bent upon equality, then why don’t they accept the demand for Universal Civil Code (UCC)? NO!! You see, when the debate is about UCC, they quote Article 25 of the Constitution which gives the right to practice one’s own religion and claim various special privileges as a religious right; for eg. four wives, triple talaq, etc. And when the discussion pertains to giving citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from neighbouring Islamic countries, they jump to Article 14 !! In other words, they pick and choose that which suits them.

  
So the next time you meet a leftist/liberal or Muslim who says that they oppose CAA because it goes against Article 14 and the principle of equal treatment, ask him if he supports Universal Civil Code. If he denies or gives you a lengthy nonsensical answer as to why he opposes UCC, then he stands exposed ; proving that he / she is not really interested in secularism. 

  
It is amazing that channels like NDTV who claim to present facts as they are have never seen fit to inform Indians about the vastly disproportionate number of Muslim students in JMI. Nor do they call out the hypocrisy of JMI “students”. If they would have, the whole country would have learnt that these protests have nothing to do with “secularism”.

  
Now it is up to us to spread the word. Please share / forward this article so that the truth about JMI is known to everyone.

My thoughts and prayers go out to the friends and families of the slain policemen, to the forces who were targeted, and the Indian nation at large. No person should have to receive the remains of their loved ones lost to terrorism.

I am writing this as someone who has been trying to make sense of all of this for quite a few hours now. I am also making it a point to only post it on Reddit because it is easily the most sophisticated form of social media in our part of the world. I understand and completely empathize with the emotions right now, and I'll probably be downvoted, but I wanted to engage with you all in a dialogue in the wake of this crisis that has befallen our beloved subcontinent.

As a Pakistani who grew up in Lahore, I am no stranger to terrorism. I have not only faced it in my hometown, but my family has been a direct victim of it. The nation of Pakistan has paid a huge price to terrorism, home-grown or otherwise. And we continue to do so. Anyone who sympathizes with terrorists is a common enemy of the people of Pakistan and India, and there can never be two ways about it.

Having said that, I'm here to request you to take a deeper look into all of this before you come at our throats for this. I won't deny that Pakistan hasn't been involved in alternative warfare before (we're 1/10th the size of India, with a largely inferior defense machinery, our forces probably deemed it the only way of keeping the Indian advances in check - unfortunate), but this attack doesn't seem like the doing of Pakistan or its forces.

Let's get some context. In recent times, the government has been trying its best to resume dialogue with India. There's the Kartarpur corridor that the government is really trying to push hard on. Also, in the upcoming days, Pakistan awaits MBS from KSA, and with him comes a lifeline for Pakistan. Kalboshan Yadav trial is set to start in a few days, and turning the world against us would do the country no good in the ICJ. And to dig even deeper, Pakistan would not want to give the Modi government a chance to run their anti-Pakistan narrative again and come back into power.

Unsettling the status quo does not work in the favor of Pakistan, or our forces. Maybe, just maybe this is an all-Kashmiri attack this time around? Masood Azhar may have been in Pakistan at some point, but Jaish-e-Mohammad is banned here, and yes, these groups are capable of planning and carrying out activities on their own. Why do I know that? I grew up in Pakistan's decade of terror.

I'm not a military shill. My history on my home sub will portray the opposite actually.I'm just here to request you to take a deeper look into everything before jumping to any conclusions. The media and the politicians will try to sell you a narrative because it works for them. We have all always maintained that Pakistanis and Indians have been kept at each others' throats for years because of our politicians, and not us. Maybe its stuff like this that allows them to do this and keep us this divided?

tl;dr. Don't take the bait, India. Let us mourn this loss with you, and you'll find the people of Pakistan standing by your side in this hour of tragedy. Furthering the war, propaganda and hostilities will achieve neither of our countries anything.  


Edit: To those I may have triggered here, please don't mistake this as a plea for mercy. This is a request to bring logic and reason into the argument. It's time we did that for a change on both sides of the border. Pakistan has more to lose from this attack than you'd realize. I completely understand the emotion, and I do feel your pain, but the threats and words you retorted to is exactly what I'm requesting you to give a second thought to.",Moderated

941,I think everyone in India should learn Hindi,5,75v8ou,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/75v8ou/i_think_everyone_in_india_should_learn_hindi/,77,"Before you freak out, hear me out. I am a south Indian so I have a unique experience with the issue. I was born and raised in Hyderabad and am elsewhere now. So right from the beginning I have learned Telugu (Mother tongue), English and Hindi. I think I can maintain a conversation in Hindi but my accent is bad. I can read and write Hindi quite well.

Everyone should learn their mother tongue first and foremost. So a telugu guy should learn telugu. A marathi guy should learn marathi. That is the first priority.

Now the question is: Should you also learn Hindi? I think every Indian should learn Hindi.

The reasons IMO are as follows :-

1. You can connect with 40% of Indian people. 
2. Only 9% of Indians can speak English. This means you literally cannot talk to you many of your compatriots in the state we are in.
3. If everyone learns Hindi then every Indian can talk to each other. This improves the national fabric and brings us closer to each other.
4. English is and always will be a foreign language. Indians will never be able to truly own and embody a foreign language.

For too long the upper echelons of power in our country were run in English which only 9% people understand. Everyone else has been left out and they feel wronged and rightly so.

Of course, the devil lies in the details. What should be the priority? Even i don't know the answer to that.

Ideally every Indian should speak their mother tongue, Hindi and English and use which ever is convenient. If you are making a political speech in Hindi states use Hindi because you will connect with more people. If you are writing a scientific paper english would be a better choice.

1. Ganesha's trunk is akin to a penis. His belly=Indian male's desire for getting blowjobs.

2. Lord Shiva is a serial adulterer & encourages adultery. His penis is worshipped as Lingam by Hindus.

3. Shiva cut off Ganesha's head owing to a theory explained by Oedipus complex.

4. Holi festival & wearing kumkum by Hindu women signifies violence & a thirst for blood innate in hindu culture.

5. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had gay sex with Swami Vivekananda.

6. Goddess Kali has an insatiable lust for sex.

7. Lord Shiva encourages ritual rape & prostitution

8. Breastfeeding Hindu mothers don't bond with their children like their counterparts in the West do.

9. Everything valuable in Hinduism comes from ""lower castes"" & 'Dalits"". Every evil comes from Brahmins & Sanskrit.

10. Hindus who fight to defend Hinduism suffer from psychological disorders which have roots in their penises. 

11. Sri Ramakrishna placed his feet on Swami Vivekananda's penis. The Hindus mistook this for the mysticism of Ramakrishna

12. Sri Ramakrishna had homoerotic relationships with young boys. Meaning=He had gay sex with his male disciples

13. Sri Ramakrishna's female Guru forced him to have sex with her.

14. Sri Ramakrishna liked to softly rub sandalwood paste on the penises of young boys

15. Stunned by the cocked hips of the boy, Ramakrishna fell into ecstasy.

16. Sri Ramakrishna's attention was caught by a Naga Sadhu's nude body & his penis.

17. Sri Ramakrishna's mystical states were generated by his pedophilia.

18. Bloodthirsty tongue and the self fed breast, homosexual fellatio fantasy in a south Indian ritual tradition=Hindu Goddess

19. Goddess Kali is a phallic being, a mother with a penis

20. Kali is a bloodied menstruating & castrating woman.

21. Ganesha's trunk is a displaced phallus, a caricature of Shiva's lingam.

22. Ganesha is celibate because he doesn't want to compete erotically with his father Shiva, a notorious womaniser #wendydoniger #paulcourtright

23. Like the eunuch, Ganesha has the power to bless & curse. #paulcourtright #wendydoniger

24. Ganesha's appetite for sweets has erotic undertones though there's no story where he's shown to enjoy oral sex. #paulcourtright

That is all I have to say now, the only form of dissent available to me.  I am too small to rally against a government that has power over the public discourse, the tools and purveyors of justice and the very people itself. The government has taken over what I eat, what I see and what I read. It has also slowly taken away what I believe or at least what I used to believe in. The pride with which the mass thumps its chest as majoritarian while also contributing to a dictatorial view of the government that was elected is bothersome. It shows me that what is on paper is not in the minds of people, the rot has now reached a far deeper. There is no more intelligentsia that looks at problems objectively, the best minds converted to conformity or chased away.

What is the pride in defending a country whose economy is about to falter? What is the pride in identifying with a mass? Why is there celebration over a perceived national and religious unity whereas basic necessities are not available to large swathes of the population and the country is built on a tattering education system that only reproduces but does not think? The colour of faith and national pride stops us from seeing the problems that plague us elsewhere, trying to pretend that our problems do not exist or trying to save face before the rest of the world is not a magic pill. The country was built on shaky foundations of poverty and misinformation, the political forces that followed have reaped merry on these resources. This could also be termed as a post-colonial hunt for identity and there is enough theory written, the practice is based on emotion and fear. No amount of sense can be breathed upon a person subsumed by thought control.

Seeing the temple being built reaffirms that there is no longer a future in this country. All for what? A mythical character in a story who would not have cared if one worshipped him or not. Where the biggest issues is of an outside enemy the bigger problems that plague the country go unanswered. Since most of the population does not have a conception of what the Western idea of development is (thanks to shoddy education amongst other things) they are happy to accept what they get at face value. Today it is a mandir, tomorrow it is a pogrom. Who is to care? After all they are the majority and they feel powerful. This will not end here. Kashmir was the soup and this is the starter. It will not end before the Hindutva agenda is firmly pressed down our throats. The new generation will be an anal, flag flying and name chanting drones like the Turkish or Chinese goons that are also baying for blood. The ideals that shaped this country have been distorted and I have no longer have any hope for democracy or inclusion.

I am not siding with this anymore. When the day comes when we hang our heads in shame I will not shrug and repent. Because I am not a part of this madness. The best I can do it to renounce all my affiliation with this ideology from now on. Mark my words for it will Kashi and Mathura next. And who knows what rhyming, emotionally upbeat rally call will be next. I will be called a troll, a Pakistani or shown examples of Israelis or the Muslims.

I am one of those haters and through this post I want all of you to walk through my mind so you know the reasons on how I or any other Islam-hater became one.

Lets start from when I was a fairly neutral hindu guy.I believed in(still do) that all religions are equal,for they are different means to same god.I was as secular as a good Hindu/Sikh could be. 

Then I hear about what muslims did to Kashmiri Pandits.How they killed them and threatened them to either convert or fuck off from their 1000 year old homeland.I found out about how mob of them killed 60 innocent hindu pilgrims which initiated the 2002 Godhra riots.About how they raped a hindu girl and killed her brothers(reason for Mujaffarnagar riots).Currently these Muslims are busy playing riot-riots with Sikhs when the court orders were unfavourable to them.

Not to mention what they are doing outside India - killing,converting minorities in Pak since Independence,terrorizing whole world with organisations like Al-Qaeda,Boko Haram and ISIS.

Muslims are doing these kind of chutiyapas all over the world and you still want me to believe they are religion of peace? Get your mind checked.

You say these are acts of only few and blaming whole Islam is not justified? 

How many more instances do you want before you drop your argument of *don't generalise muslims*? I would be happy to serve you more mate,I have plenty.

Islam is one big-time fucked up religion which will never be in peace with others.You know why? Because their holy texts doesn't preach so.People of a religion are as good as their holy text,for it is what guides their behaviour.Hindus are peaceful and secular because of Vedas,Sikhs for Guru Granth Sahib and so on for Buddhists and Jains.And what does Koran teach? To kill and hate non-believers for they don't realise greatness of Islam? 

What kind of Kuran is it which tells followers to deny equal rights to women while their men can fuck and marry as much girls as they want?

Why don't muslims questions these kind of practices ? Why do they take them for granted as 'order of god' ? Every religion has questioned wrong practices in their books and have modernized with time.So,why muslims are trying to live in 21th century with a 7th century self-help book?",Non-Political

I am a Sikh. By my faith, I am forbidden to eat halal (or kuttha) meat. Besides religious reasons, and without meaning to impugn a Muslim or a Jew's faith, halal or kosher meat is produced using [some rather unpleasant methods](http://www.rspca.org.uk/ImageLocator/LocateAsset?asset=document&assetId=1232719611043&mode=prd) and has faced [scattered bans] (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2562350/Denmark-accused-anti-Semitism-bans-religious-slaughter-animals-kosher-halal-meat.html) all over the world, or debate with [scientists attesting to its inhumane nature](http://thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/121177,Scientists-claim-kosher-and-halal-animal-slaughter-is-inhumane-and-cruel).

While I was in the US, it was almost a given that fast food meat would be halal/kosher. Companies see this as a cost saving measure as Christians do not care one way or another.

The other day, I was at a KFC and saw to my horror a small sign on the right hand side of the ordering counter stating that the chicken used in the restaurant is halal (or verbiage to that effect). Yes, it is visible to the public but how many of you look 90 degrees to the right (or left) when in a queue ordering food? Its deceptive - it should be prominently displayed right above the menu.

Observant Sikhs do not eat halal. I am not sure about Hindus (some tell me that they have a similar ban, most say that they don't care). But I think that everyone ought to be aware of this before indulging in some KFC. I have read that McDonald is the same.

That this is happening in a part of India where Muslims comprise less than 5% of the population (and I can assure you - most patrons of KFC etc. are not Muslims) and there are almost no kosher-keeping Jews, is itself a curiosity.",Non-Political

The fundraiser is seeking donations not from everyday individuals but from tech giants and rich philanthropists. They have raised $ 35 million within a week.

When she was announcing the lineup of artists hosting the fundraiser, she also said Priyanka Chopra ans SRK would be a part of it. 

Its kinda sad on two levels : --

1) Why didnt SRK / Priyanka do something like this for Indian families affected by COVID-19

2) Why didnt Bolloywood or any Indian media think of organising some fundraiser like this where they would make calls to prominent philanthropists and Indian tech companies asking for donations.

Finally, its also sad that all donation drives in India seem to be prying on the everyday middle class citizen. For example : PM Cared Fund, the OLA driver salary fundraiser. Its kinda pathetic really..

Why is Modi's speech being telecast live in every National News Channel. Is his PR machinery working non-stop for his next elections?

While the NaMo PR wants us to believe the whole Indian diaspora is enthralled by his visit to US, the ground reality is much different: [Massive protests mark Modi's visit to Silicon Valley](http://modifail.com/protest/)

“It’s important to compare Narendra Modi’s words versus his actions” 

I managed to catch the end of his speech on TV making people cry hoarse Bharat Mata ki Jai' and saying they aren't loud enough for people in India to hear it - as if that is going to bring about any changes. Then while he was stepping doing , the presenter was crying out like the presenter announcing Mike Tyson's name over the microphone ring-style and asking the people to chant Modi Modi, what exactly is the PR machinery doing?

Take the now popular BBC documentary - perhaps the idea is proposed from a good intention of exposing the issues involved, but somebody sees the opportunity, greases some palms, and involves themselves; maybe they change the content slightly to generalize things beyond the incident it's based on, maybe they simply ensure it's marketed in a way that's helpful to their own propaganda. It's even possible that our govt came across some intelligence of such ideas planned based on the documentary, leading to the much-maligned ban - I have no evidence to believe this, I'm just saying that a lot of things could be going on behind the scenes.

The US definitely understands the power of media in the modern world, and India and China are the two major nations that are perceived as new and developing threats to US. 

""Rape epidemic"" was a bad enough term, but by tagging us as a ""rape culture"" entirely, India is affected on multiple fronts: 

* Tourism - a segment this govt sees the potential of (see ""Swacch Bharath"" and comments by PM elsewhere) - will be paralyzed entirely as people automatically think ""rape"" when they think of India. 

* Whether or not this ""German professor"" thing is true, if this ""rape culture"" tag is allowed to enter the popular consciousness, such things will factor in at least unconsciously in the minds of deciding authorities - when deciding university admissions, job interviews, visa interviews, etc., all of it dampening India's growth. 

* If a mass hysteria builds, people get emotional, and demand lots of visible and psychologically satisfying security in place - which is what is called ""security theater"". So, the administration's resources would have to be wasted on ""security theater"" rather than actual security, which again slows growth. 

I don't know how much of a probability I myself will attach to this theory, but I hope this at least gets some of you thinking about such possibilities. [Here's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Operations_%28United_States%29#Cold_War) a small subset of the US's PsyOps done decades ago, I hope you can extrapolate how much went unexposed and how much their techniques would have been ""improved"" in the decades since.

These allegations are false cries and are disgusting. These allegations made by the opposition have been completely punctured after a point by point here.

1. Allegation : The different purchases worth Rs. 206 Cr. For Anganwadis was carried out without eTendering process

Reality : This is a false allegation. The purchases made by Women and Child Development Department have been done based on Govt. Approved Rate Contracts. eTendering is not needed when the Rate Contracts are available.

2. Allegation : The Government Resolutions related to the purchase have not been uploaded on the Govt. Website

Reality : As these are purchase related work orders, they were not put on the govt. website. In the tenure of the previous governments also, Govt. Resolutions related to any of the purchases were not put on the website

3. Allegation : The purchase was approved without verifying the manufacturing capacity of M/s Suryakanta Mahila Audyogic Sahakari Sanstha

Reality : The rate contract was approved on verification of all the points associated with the manufacturing units of M/s Suryakanta Mahila Audyogic Sahakari Sanstha by the Technical Team of the CSPO. The Women and Child Development Department has also verified the unit. Therefore the allegation that the purchases were approved without verifying the manufacturing capacity is wrong.

4. Allegation : The purchase from M/s Bhavani Enterprises was approved in only one day

Reality : Rate Contract is available for M/s Bhavani Enterprises and therefore the purchase was approved. However, the propaganda being made in this regard is completely false. The purchase from M/s Bhavani Enterprises was approved on the basis of Govt. Rules and Laid Down process.

5. Allegation : The contracts were allotted to unauthorized Firms

Reality : This allegation is also an utter falsehood. The purchase orders were allotted to the firms authorized in Rate Contracts provided by the approved agencies. Contracts are not allotted to any unauthorized firm.

6. Allegation : M/s Jagadguru Printing Pvt. Ltd. does not have copyright registration

Reality : Shree Tekawade has done the copyright consent agreement with M/s Jagadguru Printing Pvt. Ltd. In this, as per the Terms and Conditions of the contract, the rights for printing, selling, and publication of the associated books are available with M/s Jagadguru Printing Pvt. Ltd and therefore purchase order was given to M/s Jagadguru Printing Press.

7. Allegation : Cheque of value of Rs. 5.6 crores was credited into the account of the contractor

Reality : This allegation is also a complete falsehood. The Commissioner of Women and Child Development has issued the cheque in the same of the associated firm i.e. M/s Jagadguru Printing Pvt. Ltd. The cheque was not issued in the same of any individual.

8. Allegation : The Water Filter of value Rs. 4500 was purchased at Rs. 5200.

Reality : The Govt. Rate contract mentions the cost of Water Filter at Rs. 4500/- and Water Filter with Storage Capacity at Rs. 5200/-. The water filter with storage capacity has been purchased and therefore the allegations made in this regard are baseless and misleading for the people. The water filter with storage capacity has been done based only on the costs mentioned in the Rate Contract.

9. Allegation : M/s Suryakanta does not have its plant to manufacture Chikki

Reality : M/s Suryakanta has its own plant. This plant is at Vengurla and it has been verified.

10. Allegation : The provision for Medical Kits was for Rs. 500 and yet, Rs. 720 were charged.

Clarification: This allegation is also completely false and misleading. Medical Kits have been purchased based on the provisions of the Central Govt. at Rs. 599/-. As per the Terms and Conditions mentioned in the Tender, The Commissioner (Integrated Child Development Scheme) has the rights to change the quantity of the Medicines and the cost of Medical Kit was reduced to Rs.599/- from Rs. 720/- to fit into the limit of Central Govt. of Rs. 600/-.

Misinformation in regards to eTendering

The state govt. has issued a GR through General Administration Department on 18. December 2014, making it mandatory for carrying out purchases above Rs. 3 Lakhs. However, this tender is for carrying out e Tendering instead of paper based Tendering for all purchases above Rs. 3 Lakhs and therefore for any of the purchases, if the Rate Contracts are already available, e Tendering is not required. The purchases done by the Women and Child Development Department are as per the Rules and Regulations as mentioned above. These purchases are done on the basis of the Rate Contracts finalized by the Director General of Supplies and Disposals (DGS & D) of the Industries Department and Central Government. Also, all the purchases were made in FY 2014-15 i.e. before March 2015.
However, the Government Orders, making e Tendering mandatory for any purchases above Rs. 1 Crore even if the Rate Contract are available, were issued after this period, i.e. on 17. April 2015. However, it may be noted that the above purchases were done before March 2015. Therefore the question of carrying out eTendering for purchases above Rs. 1 Crores did not arise.
If the decision of the aforementioned purchases was not taken, it would not have been possible to utilize the funds in the then current Financial Year i.e. before 31. March 2015. These funds would have been lapsed and the funds would not be available for the anganwadi children and the funds would have been available only in the new financial year with a delay. The Central Govt. share in this funds would have been lapsed and would not have be available again. In the mean time, the beneficiaries of this schemes would be completely neglected and the supplies would have been shut for them.

The purchases of the previous govt. on the basis of the same Rate Contract

It may be noted that the Rate Contract used for above mentioned purchases were finalized in the time of the previous Congress-NCP Govt. Also, the previous Congress-NCP Govt. did purchases on the basis of the same Rate Contracts. It needs to be understood that the purchases of Rs. 164 Crores in 2012-13, Rs. 127 Crores in 2013-14 ad Rs. 56 Crores in June-July 2014 have been made.

For example, I was reading an article through r/india about nalwa being #1 warrior and general comments were y not Ashoka, Maurya or this must have been written by khalistani. So Nalwa belongs to Khalistani now. I m proud of Sardar Patel,Ashoka, Subhashchandar Bose and all those great souls and I certainly dont think they belonged to particular sect/religion but just to India. Now, please dont over concentrate on this part but try to see the logic i m trying to get at. Long story short, at the end of day we all are Indians. I see muslim, AAP bashing everywhere. Y?? This is not r/bjp. y cant we all sit and see pros/cons of our society, political parties rather than name calling such as Aaptards/moditards/sickularists. At the end i would like to say diversity has been the beauty of India and thats what, atleast, I enjoy the most.

AMAA! No details about me, my company or past jobs I did. I am not taking any names. 

The whole net neutrality chapter was really good and I was glad to see majority of Indian Internet Netizens come online to support something. Obviously I was happy cos this gave me opportunities. So... We got a assignment to turn this whole thing against Flipkart. And I did it successfully. I first started it with Whatsapp forwards. We built pretty graphics and forwarded them. Then I started with twitter and facebook. trust me, we were not only the firm who did this ;)

Two of the twitter hashtags I started trended nicely. I paid one of the FB pages, who posted 'Get well soon Bansals' and asked people to send flowers (I picked this idea from /r/india itself). Well, few people did actually send flowers to FK office. 

I am active on randia from many years. The teenagers here are very naive. Thats why I posted here. Don't trust blindly anything on media you see.

Why not against Google or Facebook? Or even Google India or Facebook India? Or directly against Airtel or Reliance? I am pretty sure these thoughts never came to you. As soon as Flipkart backed out, the whole thing toned down so slow and almost died. Have you observed this?

I was thinking more along the lines of adding a bot to the subreddit which would translate from one language to another within the 22 languages. For eg, if someone types in Gujarati, I could reply to that comment with something like !tohindi which would invoke the bot to translate the Gujarati to hindi and reply to my comment with the translation.

Devanagari or any other script is usually difficult to type with unless you use something like Google Translate so most of the posts would still be in English but for the people from rural areas who are comfortable with and only use Devanagari keyboards on their phones (for eg: my grandmother) a bot like this could be very useful.

I am an Iraqi who after growing up in Iraq under the heels of the mullahs who screwed up my entire nation escaped to Turkey and from there on shifted to London.

Over there I encountered the Indian diaspora and moved in with a Indian roommate \( from hyd\)

Now, I always wanted to know about people who decided it was their right to establish a caliphate in my country and turn into a complete wasteland and hence began looking into the subcontinent affairs

Imagine my shock when I first encountered Hindi Muslims telling me that they were of Arab ancestry \( one even showed me a family tree which was allegedly passed onto him from the times of Prophet Adam \( the first man \)

Anyway that is a separate issue, but having recently become involved with both ur's and America's politics, I am astounded to see the Indian liberal or self proclaimed leftists have more in common with Iraqi mullah right wingers \( same in America\)

Also, the idea that Modi and Trump are some kind Hitler like figures is absolute tosh and ridiculous

Firstly can any1 please tell me when at any point of history has a fascist head had dissenters leave alone at 4 years in his term but even before coming to power.

Be it Hitler, Pinochet,  Mao every one of them had popularity and none dared oppose them.

Even my country's people accepted Saddam.

Indian and American left are the only 2 groups who make the bold claim to have stopped the fascist head of state from completely taking over ever in history.

Also can any1 tell me when in ANY POINT OF HISTORY have minority groups under persecution been able to be openly hostile to the party in power

HECK U HAVE CLERGY openly putting bounty's on his head, even awarding money for beheading his party members.

Could jews do it in 30's Germany, Shias under Saddam, hindus in Pakistan, Christians in ME, COMMUNISTS under Pinochet.

THIS IS ALSO imp, can any1 tell me when in history have a persecuted group run to a nation that is persecuting them.

India \( Burma Muslims \) and USA \( REFUGEES\) 

The idea that military style takeover will happen \( aka hitler \) under Modi is laughable

Fascist state emerges when a group of people decide to exploit natural resources and want cheap bonded labour or serfdom working for them

Pinochet for Chile Copper Mines.

Also Bonded labour which is the primary goal for a fascist state already exists in the form of dalits working in one of ur major natural resources of India \( agriculture\)

Plus for a miliraty or martial rule to apply it can be done only on a small state which is small in size and whose population can be controlled

India and US are way big in size and no way can the state control the local population.

This was a man I indeed held in very high esteem - until today, that is because today I learned that many of his views were eerily similar to right-wing extremist Hindutva chickenhawks (sanghis) -

* **He believed Hinduism and India to be cradle of all civilization, the source of all knowledge, literature, mathematics etc.**

 >I am convinced that everything has come down to us from the banks of the Ganges, - astronomy, astrology, metempsychosis, etc... It is very important to note that some 2,500 years ago at the least Pythagoras went from Samos to the Ganges to learn geometry...But he would certainly not have undertaken such a strange journey had the reputation of the Brahmins' science not been long established in Europe.

 – Voltaire, Lettres sur l'origine des sciences et sur celle des peuples de l'Asie (first published Paris, 1777), letter of 15 December 1775.

* **He considered the Islamic invaders of India as ""barbarians""**

 >No sooner than India begin to be known to the Occident's barbarians than she was the object of their greed, and even more so when these barbarians became civilised and industrious, and created new needs for themselves.... The Albuquerques and their successors succeeded in supplying Europe with pepper and paintings only through carnage

 – Voltaire, Fragments historiques sur l'Inde, op.cit., p.383


* **He was very fond of Hindus and Hinduism**

 In contrast to his views on their invaders, he viewed Hindus as ""peaceful and innocent people, equally incapable of hurting others or of defending themselves"". 

 He also said about Vedas that ""The Veda was the most precious gift for which the West had ever been indebted to the East"".

* **His views on Christianity and Islam**

 He wrote this about Christianity in a letter to King of Prussia -

 >**[Christianity] is assuredly the most ridiculous, the most absurd and the most bloody religion which has ever infected this world.** Your Majesty will do the human race an eternal service by extirpating this infamous superstition, I do not say among the rabble, who are not worthy of being enlightened and who are apt for every yoke; I say among honest people, among men who think, among those who wish to think. … My one regret in dying is that I cannot aid you in this noble enterprise, the finest and most respectable which the human mind can point out..

 His opinion about Islam wasn't much better.

 He described Mohammed as a ""deceitful character."" He wrote that **Mohammed was ""whatever trickery can invent that is most atrocious and whatever fanaticism can accomplish that is most horrifying. Mahomet here is nothing other than Tartuffe with armies at his command.""**

 He considered Quran to be ignoring the laws of physics. Thus, there are a number of representations of Mohammed by Voltaire, a religious one, according to which Mohammed is a prophet like the others, who exploits people's naivety and spreads superstition and fanaticism, and the other a political one, according to which Mohammed was a legislator who brought his contemporaries out of idolatry. According to Diego Venturino, Voltaire applauds the legislator but hates the conqueror and the pontiff, who established his religion through violence.

While everyone was criticizing this move, there was this one uncle who stood his ground that emergency time was not at all bad for the common man, in fact it was very good.

This uncle used to work in a public sector bank at that time and he says that efficiency of working improved a great deal, employees started coming to offices on time, and worked hard. Corruption had reduced to almost non-existent levels as corrupt employees were afraid of taking bribes because now the govt. agencies had increased powers to arrest them. Be it traffic cops, railway clerks or bank employees, everyone worked efficiently and the end result was a better society for the common dude who worked honestly.

The only people who weren't happy with emergency were political opposition and the media. Political opponents did come together in the form of JP movement (just as maha-gatbandhan is now) but that movement fizzled out soon because there was no ideological unity among them, except everyone wanted Indira Gandhi to go.

As for media, they seemed to be the most hurt, hence they took revenge on the govt. and portrayed emergency in a very negative light. It wasn't all that bad if a lot of people are to be believed.",Politics

1031,Here's my take on this whole AIB Tanmay issue.,0,6nkemu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6nkemu/heres_my_take_on_this_whole_aib_tanmay_issue/,62,"So since couple of days this AIB incident has picked up quite a bit of pace since Congress has jumped in the issue. I've seen like 3 posts on Randia discussing on the same issue. I want to share what I've noticed and how we are looking for the convenient bashing to pour out our anger or possibly targeted anger. I am not associated with any party btw.

Now coming to the issue. Its unfortunate. That's only I can say for the original tweet of Tanmay Bhatt. Randians are getting carried away into believing that this whole issue was only because of Dog Filter on snapchat. Well at least that's what people are trying to discuss all over Randia and making it a FOE argument.

What no is talking about is that TB used an innocent man's picture who probably looked like Modi and mocked him on Social media most probably without taking his permission to use the photo. (He has not clarified whether he took the permission or not and I doubt that person will allow to use his photo to become a laughing stock on the internet.)
Now here I find it is morally and ethically wrong to use some innocent man's photo to target some other person in this case Modi to score some brownie points on the internet. Whoever posted his original picture probably without his permission just so he can use him to target someone else in this case Modi is also at fault but Since TB is running a startup on Internet, has quite a bit of good fan following. Shouldn't he be more careful and responsible about such stuff?


What I find ironic is that Congress has jumped in this issue to score their political goals thinking this is good for their publicity and revival of their party in the upcoming election. Its amusing since many Congressis have uploaded ""their"" picture with dog filter to troll their opponent. People started trolling as well. It probably became a pissing contest which is kind of disgusting IMO. But no one thought about that old man whose picture is being circulated on the Internet and how he might be feeling in all this.

Now I've seen like 3 top threads on Randia being discussed on the same issue as I have said earlier but I have not seen the same amount of outrage for that 17yo boy who got arrested in Bengal. Seems like FOE rant is justified based on the ability to manipulate the incident in the favor of those who wants to take advantage out of it.

This is just what I observed and I wanted to share it with my Randian fellows. There might be many errors so kindly pardon me. This was written in haste. No hard feelings friends.

Edit: Seems I am being continuously down voted. Randia is not what it use to be.

Edit2: Looks like a political party's social media cell is continuously down voting my post. You still can't suppress my voice. Kindly apply logic above your party politics.",AskIndia

They make a big deal about introducing clean, new politics to India. They make an even bigger deal about criminal charges and accusations(real or imaginary) against leaders and candidates of other parties. **In fact they and their supporters are prone to act as if any criminal charges and accusations against other parties, especially BJP, are automatically 100% true and they are guilty by default.**

So it is really curious that so many of AAP's own candidates have criminal charges in these elections and the same AAP leaders and same supporters turn HYPOCRITE and desperately defend them instead of asking their party to investigate these charges.

[27 BJP, 21 AAP, 12 Congress candidates in Delhi elections have criminal cases](http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/27-bjp-21-aap-12-congress-candidates-in-delhi-elections-have-criminal-cases/)

The behavior of the AAP fanboy army is unbeleivable. The same mouths that pretend all 27 BJP candidates are crooks also say things like *'These charges against AAP candidates are ONLY FOR PROTESTS!'* and *'These are all FAKE charges, AAP members are all INNOCENT!'* or *'GIMME PROOF, only the 21 AAP candidates need PROOF, other parties are GUILTY until proven innocent!'*

This is the full report on criminal charges against candidates in the Delhi elections.

http://adrindia.org/download/file/fid/4294

Just for perspective, let's go over the criminal charges against a few AAP candidates. They are quite serious,

**1 ) Arvind Kejriwal (New Delhi)**

-4 charges related to rioting (IPC Section-147)

-4 charges related to Assault or criminal force to
deter public servant from discharge of his duty
(IPC Section-353)

-3 charges related to Rioting, armed with deadly
weapon (IPC Section-148)

-2 charges related to Assaulting or obstructing
public servant when suppressing riot, etc. (IPC
Section-152)

-1 charge related to Wantonly giving provocation
with intent to cause riot-if rioting be committed-if
not committed (IPC Section-153)

**2 ) Manish Sisodia(PATPARGANJ)**

-3 charges related to rioting (IPC Section-147)

-3 charges related to Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty (IPC Section-353)

-2 charges related to Rioting, armed with deadly weapon (IPC Section-148)

-1 charge related to Assaulting or obstructing public servant when suppressing riot, etc. (IPC Section-152)

-1 charge related to Wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot-if rioting be committed-if not committed (IPC Section-153)

**3 ) Sahu Ram(TUGHLAQABAD)**

I realize that with their mental conditioning most AAP fanboys will just downvote without reading or spew abuse against me. And that the massive AAP social media machine will quickly mobilize trolls from across facebook, twitter and reddit to bury this post for the sake of their 'honest politics'.

**But I appeal to anyone *genuinely* concerned about clean politics: Please read this post and read the link I have given.** I have checked the report thoroughly and there are indeed 21 AAP candiates with criminal charges, of which many are serious.

-Rioting

-Assault

-Criminal Intimidation

-Cheating

-Counterfeiting money

-Death by negligence

-Sexual assault

And so on. **Please think before posting: If these people did not belong to AAP would you automatically declare them as innocent and wrongfully accused? Or would you be skeptical of them and their 'clean' politics?**

And **whatever excuses you make in favour of AAP, would you make the same for candidates from other parties or do you apply a different set of standards for judging them?**

For a country located nearly 3000 miles away, these Muslims sure care a lot about Israel and Palestinians.

OK ... time for a history lesson.


1947- Muslims cause the partition of India. Riots happen across the subcontinent because of Jinnah's appeal for ""[Direct Action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Action_Day)"". No Muslim outrage.

1948 - Despite being majority, [Hindus routinely killed and raped](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Hindus#During_the_era_of_Nizam_state_of_Hyderabad) in Hyderabad. No Muslim outrage.

1971- Pakistan's muslim army kills lakhs of [Hindu men and rapes lakhs of Hindu women](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide). No Muslim outrage.

1985- A [62 year old muslim woman and her 5 children gets denied maintenance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohd._Ahmed_Khan_v._Shah_Bano_Begum) by her husband, due to the pressure of Orthodox Muslim groups. No Muslim outrage.




Lets skip a few years and come into the 21st century-



2002- Muslims [burn a train full of hindu pilgrims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godhra_train_burning), for no reason at all. No Muslim outrage.

2012- Muslims [destroy a war memorial](http://shariaunveiled.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/india-mumbai-war-memorial-resized.jpg) in Mumbai, under the pretext of protesting Assam riots. No Muslim outrage.

2013-Muslims riot in Muzaffarnagar after they kill two Hindu boys for protesting against harassment of their sister. They burn shops, rape women. No Muslim outrage

2014- Muslims riot in Saharanpur after they were unsuccessful in occupying a land that belonged to the Sikhs and was to be used for a Gurudwara. They plunder shops, set fire and kill innocent bystanders. No Muslim outrage.


A country located 2800 miles away from India launches a military operation to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks. Muslims are outraged.


Dead children, dead men, women being raped and killed. Nobody cares. However, if a country 2800 miles away acts in the interest of self-preservation, all hell breaks loose. 

Meanwhile, in another country next to Israel, Muslims are fighting among themselves. If its not Muslims vs non-Muslims, its Shia vs Sunnis. Or Ahmadis vs Sunnis. Or any random group/sect you think of. They always find an excuse to quench their blood-thirst.

Lets stop being politically correct and think for some time. Are these people really ""innocent minorities"" as the Indian news media often makes them out to be? Take any prominent riot or mob-violence in the history of India, Muslims are almost **always** involved. Islam is a violent, fascist cult whose goal is to convert as many people as possible to it. Tolerance is not only absent, it is seen as a weakness that can be taken advantage of. Using derogatory words for individuals that do not belong to their religion is common for Muslims. A sense of superiority and entitlement, however misplaced, is something seen in Indian Muslims all the time. Their holy book declares that world-domination is the ultimate goal of Islam. Convert as many as you can, and kill the rest.

Let me state my opinion loud and clear. I don't care if you call me communal, bigoted, right-winged, BJP supporter or whatever. I **DO NOT** believe that Muslims are a minority in India. I absolutely **DO NOT** believe that they are oppressed, poor, innocent souls that are the victims of the the majority community all the time. I believe that Muslims are the perpetrators of almost all the violence and civil unrest that this country faces. Their arrogance and intolerance is what is wrong with them. In the present times, Islam is the **single biggest** danger that India faces today and must be **STRICTLY DEALT WITH**, no matter what it takes.

They say unlike the UPA the NDA lacks the necessary talent (bureaucrats and technocrats , many of whom have left the government because the government refuses to work with them like Amitabh Kant) and is filling the gap which academics, and technocrats should fill , with under educated individuals . And this shows up in lack lustre implementation of policies.

A prime example of this is the Jan Dhan Yojana which was another Congress policy implemented and taken credit for by this government.

According to the latest statistics 54% of the accounts have no money in them . While that number has come down from 76%. Its more or less found its bottom.

Considering its costs the government 125 rupees per account to maintain these accounts. The cost to the exchequer is actually around 1000 crore. Most banks are in fact not even breaking even.

This is a classic example of the government and how Modi lack the necessary talent to both implement policy and make new ones.

I don't really care about the attacks themselves if they were necessary they were necessary, but the fact that the government is going around bragging about makes me gag with horror. The whole fucking idea of a covert op is that it remains a covert op and not an opportunity to impress your bhakt voters. A legitimate government doesn't go around bragging about breaking international laws. 


Let me remind you of the quote, ""When yoi fight monsters beware of becoming one yourself."" When Pakistan violates International law it loses its credibility and standing among countries. India had the moral high ground over Pakistan. They could raise the issue in the UN and slowly build up sanctions and turn other countries against Pakistan. However now they can't do that without Pakistan raising the same issues against them. Not to forget, Bangladesh and Nepal and even Burma will start wondering if India will do the same to them,driving them right into China's loving arms. In the long term scheme of things a few terrorist attacks every few years is barely a dent on the military and machinery of India. Almost No organization has ever been able to overpower a state using Terrorism. In fact, more terrorist attacks leads to more negative public opinion of the organisations. But if the state breaks laws to get petty revenge against the terrorists, public opinion will shift against the state. This entire ""Surgical strike"" gains India nothing, and loses quite a lot. Not to mention that it is reckless, two nuclear powers threatening war? If the Indian government wanted to perform some operation to ensure national security they could easily do it, the importance is that it remains covert, so that when someone in the UN or The Hague brings it up you have deniability.

I am not a Pak sympathizer, I am just looking at the issue really critically. Because for now, all we have is a before and after picture of the burnt boat. Couple of years ago, the Italian marines shot two fishermen and tried to twist the story, as soon as they knew they fucked up. What do you guys think?

Update: http://m.firstpost.com/india/terror-boat-or-not-what-you-need-to-know-about-pakistan-vessel-that-exploded-2028573.html just a little more clarity.

In a midnight operation in the high seas on New Year's Eve, a Pakistani fishing boat said to be carrying explosives was intercepted by the Indian Coast Guard off the shores of Gujarat, but the vessel exploded and caught fire before sinking along with four occupants.

The incident, which occurred some 365 km off the coast of Porbander, generated strong speculation that it was another attempted attack of the kind Mumbai witnessed in 2008, when 10 terrorists landed in south Mumbai from the sea and killed over 170 people at the Taj, the Trident and the CST suburban station.

While Pakistan rejected such reports, the defence ministry said they had received intelligence information that helped them intercept the boat.

Here's all you need know about the incident which has worsened already sour ties between India and Pakistan.

- An intelligence-based midnight operation was conducted by Coast Guard ships and aircraft to intercept the suspected fishing boat.

- The National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) was reportedly tracking the boat right after it left Karachi. NTRO later notified the Coast Guard about the boat, after which it was tracked down using a Dornier aircraft.

- DNA reports that ""a Coast Guard Dornier aircraft undertook sea-air coordinated search and located the suspect fishing boat. Thereafter, the Coast Guard ship on patrol in the area was diverted and intercepted the unlit boat at about midnight of 31 December""

- The intercept took place following a precise intelligence-based, Coast Guard Inspector General (Operations) KR Nautiyal said.

- The Defence Ministry said the Coast Guard ship warned the fishing boat to stop for further investigation of the crew and cargo. However, the boat increased its speed and tried to escape from the Indian side of the maritime boundary.

- The hot pursuit continued for nearly one hour and the Coast Guard ship managed to stop the fishing boat after firing warning shots.

- Four persons were seen on the boat who disregarded all warnings by the Coast Guard ship to stop and cooperate with investigations.

- According to the Ministry of Defence, ""Soon thereafter, the crew hid themselves in the deck below and set the boat on fire, which resulted in an explosion and major fire on the boat.""

- Due to darkness, bad weather and strong winds, the boat and persons on board could not be saved or recovered. The boat burnt and sank in the same position, in the early hours of 1 January.

- While there has been speculation that this could have been a aborted fidayeen attack, DNA also quoted a senior intelligence official as saying, ""If it really was a boat carrying terrorists for a 26/11 kind of an attack, its crew would have attacked the Coast Guard ship first and blown up the boat only after harming the Coast Guard.""

- Meanwhile, an Indian Express report said, ""new evidence has begun to emerge that those on board might have been small-time liquor and diesel smugglers, ferrying bootleg cargo from the port of Gwadar to other fishing boats which were to have carried it into Karachi's Keti Bandar harbour.""

- Even as the incident saw much shock and speculation in India, Pakistan vehemently denied that the boat was carrying terrorists. Pakistani Foreign Office Spokesman Tasnim Aslam categorically denied the reports and told the media that no boat from Karachi had gone to the open seas. Pakistan's Defence Ministry officials also rejected the reports and said the Indians were ""trying to divert attention"" from the killing of two Pakistan Rangers on 31 December. ""It is part of Indian propaganda to tarnish the image of Pakistan,"" a Defence Ministry official told PTI.

- On Friday, Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said, ""I congratulate the Coast Guard for the timely action of intercepting a boat carrying suspected terror groups with surgical precision, thereby eliminating danger.""

- However, according to DNA, intelligence officers are still wondering why the boat was chased. It reports that, ""According to UN convention, a nation can chase or intercept suspicious vessels if they prohibit the passage of the host nation's passage or if they (suspicious vessels) loiter above or under the surface of the sea. That was not the case here, officials say.""

- While neither Gujarat or Maharashtra police were informed about any intelligence report about any boat along the coast being watched, a senior Gujarat police official told Indian Express, ""You don't need to be a genius to figure out we should have been told, because, if the fishing boat was actually carrying explosives and managed to evade patrols on the seas, we should have been in position waiting for it.""

- As speculation mounts on whether this was actually a terror attack or not, Indian Express said three naval officers had told the newspaper, ""it was inconceivable that Pakistani fishing boats -typically four-crew vessels, with an average length of less than 25 metres and equipped with 80-220 horsepower diesel engines, or smaller mechanised sailboats with 30 horsepower engines - could outrun the Coast Guard's state-of-the-art ships.""",Non-Political

Graham Stuart Staines (1941 – 22 January 1999) was an Australian Christian missionary who, along with his two sons Philip (aged 10) and Timothy (aged 6), was burnt to death by a gang while sleeping in his station wagon at Manoharpur village in Keonjhar district in Odisha, India on 22 January 1999. In 2003, a Bajrang Dal activist, Dara Singh, was convicted of leading the gang that murdered Graham Staines and his sons, and was sentenced to life in prison.

He had been working in Odisha among the tribal poor and lepers since 1965. Some Hindu groups alleged that Staines had forcibly converted or lured many Hindus into Christianity; Staines' widow Gladys denied these allegations. She continued to live in India caring for leprosy patients until she returned to Australia in 2004. In 2005 she was awarded the fourth highest civilian honor in India, Padma Shree, in recognition for her work with leprosy patients in Odisha.

Of course, you can't put anything past anyone these days, but I highly doubt that the people who spend most of their lives, away from civilization, locked in mosques around the world, praying, and talking about praying when they're not actually praying, would do anything like that. That is literally the mission of the Tablighi Jamat, they're basically Muslim sanyasis. Seriously, it's a matter of pride for them that they have nothing to do with the ""material world"", as they call it. They're literally oblivious, which exactly why they didn't pay heed to the coronavirus situation. Granted, that was extremely dangerous and wrong, but I still very much doubt that these people even know any vulgar songs, much less that they can muster the courage to sing any in unison to harass the nurses. 

Obviously, there is zero proof of any such occurrence. Aaj Tak basically hovered over a letter from the hospital staff for a few seconds, which said that these patients were being uncooperative with no mention of lewd behaviour, while yelling about ""jamatiyon ki kaali kartoot"". Sure, maybe they have been uncooperative because they're stubborn fools, but I doubt the other stuff about them dropping their pants is real lmfao. 

Of course, this is my opinion, based on my knowledge and experiences, and everyone is free to believe what they want, but I'd encourage you to exercise a healthy amount of skepticism while watching news these days. More so when you're sitting with your family, watching channels like Aaj Tak or Zee News (I know boomers love sensationalized news stories). Don't believe any of it until you see absolutely concrete proof. Most people here know this, but these channels are trying to push a narrative (with support from certain people), and they'll go to any lengths to do so. Facts and consequences don't matter to these people, as long as they get more viewers. It's a win-win for them, their overseers get to disseminate propaganda and stay happy with them, while they get TRP. Then they can say things like ""Aaj Tak ne sabko pacchada, no. 1 since the beginning of time"" and rub it in your faces.",Politics

Advance disclaimer: I have absolutely no sources or no proof for any of this. This is purely speculation from my side. Take it as you may.

1. Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement was sponsored and supported with the objective of causing an Arab Spring type revolution in India which would take the incumbent government and existing systems out of play. This was the first step.

2. The next step was for the power vacuum to be filled by Arvind Kejriwal and his yet to be created party.

3. The third step was for AK's disruptive government/party to break-up India in the name of decentralization and mobocratic anti-corruption. Like many leftist revolutionaries, these guys are all set to dismantle all of the existing power structures and systems in India under the excuse of their being corrupt. This is how they plan to weaken and break up India.

4. The fourth step was for any and all types of foreign powers and groups to carve up the weak and broken India as they pleased over the next few years / decades.

Fortunately for us, the first step didn't turn into an Arab Spring-like revolution. Nevertheless, the second step of the plan went ahead and AK floated a party which is trying to take the top spot.

Fortunately for us and unfortunately for them, the top spot didn't become a vacuum, nor did they turn out to be the default choice to fill it. Instead, the default choice at the moment appears to be BJP and Modi. Thus, AK's and AAP's top priority is now to bring down Modi. If they manage to do that, BJP may or may not be able to keep AAP from taking the top spot. If AAP reaches the top spot, steps 3 and 4 above may resume.",Politics

**Revamped Rules**

**CONTENT REMOVAL:** In an effort to make /r/india more welcoming for everyone and promote healthy discussions, we have been actively removing personal-attacks, name-calling, hate-speech and similar degrading comments for the past one year. The results are pretty evident and as a lot of you will agree, this subreddit has improved in terms of atmosphere and hostility. However, these simple rules around being civil, tend to get lost somewhere between in the long wiki and sidebar, so we’ll add a concise version of these rules to the sidebar in the coming days, which will act as easily accessible pointers for all participants of /r/india. Here’s what it will look like in the sidebar -

**NOT ALLOWED:**

* Personal attacks or name-calling against users. 

* Hate speech & Bigotry - denigrating communities on the basis of race, religion, caste, gender, sexual orientation and/or political orientation

* Unmarked NSFW/NSFL/Shock content

* Personal information & Spam

* Witch-hunt and drama threads around /r/india rules/bans/mods/users - we’ll make a feedback thread once every 2 months and you are most welcome to discuss, appreciate or critique the rules in that thread. 

Additionally, we have Automoderator removing slurs which are generally used to attack users. As with any automation, there are bound to be false positives and we’ll take care to approve these wrongly removed comments ourselves. 

**SELF-POSTS & CONTEXT:** /r/india is not your personal soapbox where you make a self-post with some baiting title and leave the users to squabble about it. All serious self posts, need to have sufficient context added by OP (one liners to bypass rules will not do). We’ll exempt fun and generic question posts from this rule, but again, we’ll use our discretion for it. Political & Religious posts will not be exempted under any circumstances.


**UNVERIFIED TWITTER:** Links to unverified twitter accounts of individuals are NOT allowed. We may allow unverified accounts of widely accepted media outlets, like TheHindu, Newslaundry etc, based on our discretion. 
 
**OLD NEWS ARTICLES:** Based on your feedback, any news story older than 3 months needs to mention [OLD] in the title. This is avoid click-baiting and misleading the readers.

**NEW FLAIRS:** We are working on implementing the new flairs you suggested. There are some technical issues we are facing and would like to hear your ideas. We will be making a separate post about it after this thread expires.

1106,Response to all the intolerance deniers in India,0,45y4bp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/45y4bp/response_to_all_the_intolerance_deniers_in_india/,19,"Ok, I had enough of this intolerance debate, like most of you, but not in the way you think. Let me define the two sides in this debate first. I am on the side of the so called ‘intellectuals’, ‘liberals’, or ‘pseudo secularists’, and the ‘other side’ that I’ll refer to below is the people who are of the opinion that this intolerance talk is a bunch of politically motivated crap and everyone doing it has a political agenda, OR…(drumbeat).. is an ‘anti national’! One thing we’ll all agree on, I believe is there is a lot of intolerance on the conversation about intolerance

For the intolerance deniers, if you really don’t think sentiments have been changing in the past few years, then you definitely are not reading anything online. Just take a look at the comments section (below) of any article that has any reference to Muslims, intolerance, or could be on any other topic but is just authored by a Muslim. The comments are so ‘colorful’ and ‘abusive’ against a certain community that there are more ‘special character’ letters being used than regular characters, and almost universally all the dirty expletives are being uttered by Hindus (or Whites/Christian Majority nations) against Muslims. 

The level that our dear Indians have stooped to, in online conversation, is beyond what the rest of the world has done and the conversations start and end with disgusting ‘maa behen’ language against a certain community. Just based on religion, without knowing who the person is, or what their views are. The anonymity that the online world provides is exposing the true mindset of the majority community in India, and in many other nations as well. Let’s focus on India though, as the reasons for Muslim hatred vary a bit based on the country. The majority will say that the Muslim hatred in rooted in them being the source/cause of terrorism, support our neighbouring country, give importance only to their religion, or they are against our country. Seriously? That is very similar to saying that all blacks (say in USA) are criminals and drug dealers, or all Tamils are terrorists (as they sympathized with LTTE), or all Biharis in Mumbai are paanwallas. Judging a whole community because of a few bad elements in it is as horrible a crime as can be. After 9/11, many Americans thought anyone with a brown skin is an Arab and a terrorist. Do we really want to stoop so low in our thinking? Can’t we differentiate between innocent women and children being killed in Gujarat (even if they are Muslims) vs. the real extremists (such as ISIS) being killed? Aren’t Hindus known to be the inheritors of the Ram Rajya of ‘dharma’ and justice, who will never punish an innocent person? A true believer of Dharma will never allow the killing of an innocent person to go unpunished, no matter what religion the person belongs to. 

This is a good Segway to the first talking point of the so-called hypocrisy that the other side accuses the ‘intellectuals’ of. We only raise a hue and cry when Muslims are affected, but not when Hindus are affected. For example, did the media make a big issue of the Kashmiri Pundits being kicked out of Kashmir? (You can almost see their heads nodding arrogantly on reading this). That is the typical hogwash that they emit to try to convince themselves about how wrong the other side is. The thinking and principles of the ‘intellectuals’ is crystal clear..we will oppose anybody who harms an innocent person. This means we will strongly oppose animals like ISIS members, the killers of the Bangladeshi Bloggers, 26/11 Terrorists, Godhra train killers, AND the killers of innocent people in the Godhra riots, killers of Sikhs in 1984, killers of an innocent person in Dadri, and killers of an innocent write in Karnataka who spoke about intolerance. 

All these are grave crimes that cannot go unpunished. Justice should see no distinction and take no sides.  We are the ones opposing ALL forms of injustice, whereas the only response you guys have when asked about an innocent minority person being killed is ‘Why are not talking about Kashmiri Pundits’?,  or something of that sort. We are NOT the hypocrites, YOU are! Case CLOSED, and hypocrisy EXPOSED! There is no explanation that you can give to justify that reaction. An innocent person being killed should be condemned. Period. The fact the you guys are trying to avoid or cover up or distract from the topic of innocent killings shows that you actually condone it, and that is a result of the hatred in your mind. There is no other explanation, so stick your response you’re forming in your mind, in your ‘ear’!

When Aamir Khan highlighted atrocities against Dalits and women in Satyamev Jayate, he was given an award by the NCSC in 2012! The same person when he highlights atrocities against Muslims, is suddenly ‘anti-national’? People talking about the nation’s capital being the ‘rape capital’ of the country are not damaging the reputation of the country, but when Aamir mentions he’s alarmed about some recent kilings the country he is ‘destroying’ the reputation of the country? Amartya Sen, Raghuram Rajan, Vishal Dadlani and numerous other hindus have also spoken out about intolerance, but there are no protests against them and no stones being thrown at their houses and cars! Moreover, it was Kiran Rao who (allegedly) made the comments, but the protests are only against Aamir Khan? That is unquestionable evidence of the hypocrisy of the ‘other side’ (many of them BJP supporters), and there is nothing you can say which can explain it away. 

Hinduism used to be associated with the best qualities – tolerance, peace, kindness, non-violence, intellectual pursuits, karma, dharma etc. etc. – and it used to have ideals that many people looked up to and aspired to emulate. I am infuriated that all these qualities are slowly being extinguished by the current mindset in India, and all these so called ‘Indians’ are destroying the image of Hinduism due to the depraved, communal, and inhuman mindset they are displaying in this whole debate.  Now, these swarms of ‘educated’ Indians who only spew anger and venom, and label anyone highlighting abhorrent incidents or differing views an ‘anti national’ and  ‘enemy of the state’. 

These ‘differences’ existed for many years, but what has changed now? I remember ShahRukh Khan made a statement in 2010 about allowing Pakistani cricketers into India and Shivsena created a ruckus and blocked MNIK screenings. But that reaction was the only limited reaction in Mumbai, and most people opposed that action from Shiv Sena. Fast forward to 2015, and a brief mention about intolerance from SRK is enough to throw vile insults, ‘anti national’ barbs, stones at his home and car, and ban his movies! The difference is that people are now emboldened to openly vent and proudly display their hatred and communal feelings in the garb of ‘patriotism’, because the ruling government has made it acceptable and ‘patriotic’ to do so. It is the same as Muslim extremists crawling out from the ground in the middle east, after ISIS came up and put forth an ideology that extremists could justify as ‘pure ISLAM’ (yes, women salves can be justified by ISIS!)

Yes, I am intolerant too, and I don’t have any qualms to admitting it! I am intolerant to people who when asked about a murder of an innocent person respond with ‘well, why are you not asking about the innocent people who got killed xx years ago?’ I am intolerant about the person who when asked about 1000s of innocent Muslim deaths in 2002, gave the answer ‘Well, why are you not asking me about the 56 deaths in the train?’ Well, Mr. PM and supporters, who the eff says the 56 deaths is not a heinous crime in itself? We do see the culprits of that crime being prosecuted though, whereas the response for the 1000s of other innocent deaths is either ‘well, if certain people cross their limits then they have to be taught a lesson’ at worst or  ‘well, it is tough to control angry mobs, and the other side is to blame for inflaming them in the first place’ at best!

I am sure that the people on the other side of this debate are grinding their teeth in anger and foaming at the mouth right now, for if there is one thing they cannot ‘tolerate’ it is somebody telling them they are wrong! I also know that this will not even change one person’s mind on the other side, for the opinions and hatred are so strongly formed in their thick skulls that you cannot penetrate it with a nuke. The only reason why I’m sending this is to rally the few individuals who are on my side and who are the saving grace of the country. We need to come together and mount a massive david vs goliath campaign against these destroyers of Indian democracy and Hinduism, because we are not going to back down on this war. This is bigger than the battle for independence of the country, and like we shuttled the brits out at that time we’ll make sure we’ll rid the nation of this poisonous mindset. Looking forward to the next round in this debate..do forward it if you want to respond or want this debate to continue..

[Article on UP](http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/uttar-pradesh-on-socio-economic-parameters/1/205359.html)

But Muslims never vote for BJP, they vote for the parties that claim to be secular, but are total fuckups when it comes to development. Why do the Muslims do so? Do they not care about the country? Don't they realize that when economic growth slows down, and poverty and inflation increases, it affects people of all communities equally? Do they not care about broken roads, rivers that are turned into sewers, illiteracy etc?

As far as the whole ""BJP is antimuslim"" rhetoric, lets face it- it is bullshit. If you are going to argue about the Gujarat Riots of 2002, you should also mention the Gopalgarh riots of Rajasthan, which happened under a Congress govt, and the Muzzafarnagar riots in UP, that happened under SP govt; both of which claim to be secular parties. As another randian said-""If you are not voting for BJP because of Gujarat riots, then you have only 2 options AAP and NOTA""

He probably was lucky to be a CM of a state where one fine day crazy Mullahs decided to burn a train. Burnt train incident snowballed into a huge riot. Swords were drawn, blood was spilled, lives were taken, and houses, societies, properties were burnt. What happened afterwards?

Riots were manipulated, ideas were sold, people were bought and polarized. Muslims were sent to ghettos and Hindus were told to jerk off and celebrate a revenge they finally took on centuries old Islamic atrocities. 

Modi was a CM, even if he wasn't directly involved, he is held responsible for whatever happened. It wouldn't have been difficult for him to immediately arrest people involved in train burning incident and prosecute them. The chootiya low level leaders probably on the behest of high level of BJP went on a rampage, literally killed the centuries old society and Bhaichara among people. You know what astonishes me the most about these rioters - these motherfuckers didn't go and single out the perpetrators of Godhra crime but they went in and raped and slashed wombs of hapless women and children. 

BJP won again in Gujarat but lost in center because of this one derailed Godhra incident. Why did MODI won in Gujarat, definitely not because of DEVELOPMENT. In one year from GODHRA incident and riots, only DEVELOPMENT he probably brought to people of Gujarat was a burnt train, parked in a yard, and an empty, burnt, and broken Gulbarg Society. My fellow brothers and sister here don't understand that he was voted to power again by Hindu brethren because he was their hope to avoid the law for the crimes that this brethren has perpetrated. 

Fast forward to today, doesn't matter how much development you bring in, how much money you feed in to that 2 year old infant who lost his world forever that fucking day when his mother was raped and dad was burnt alive. No amount of world's riches can bring his life back. So fellow brethren, Modi came back to Power not because he brought the development but because of vested interests. Evil triumphed over truth. 

Modi came to power and surprisingly BJP lost at the center because what BJP was trying to master, congress had already mastered. They know how to topple BJP in the game that they have mastered many years ago, that is polarize people, divide them on lines of caste, religion etc. On similar lines Indira and Congress won in 1984. Because of Muslims now MODI won in 2002. Thank god that rest of India didn't get played out in 2004 and voted NDA out of power. Otherwise we might have had a different day here today. However, what BJP could have done by retaining power in 2004, congress did exactly that, that is fucked us Indians over and out. 

Fast forward to preparing for 2009 general elections and eventually losing the elections. BJP noticed the electorate success MODI has enjoyed in Gujarat, at the same time saw Advani no more than a piece of old shit. They desperately needed funding and a mass leader who would propel BJP to new heights. MODI was the answer to all their troubles and questions. I don't know how much money was spent on MODI propaganda. In few years he has become a larger than life figure. Honestly he is an average orator. His voice is not clear, his English sucks, and he really does twist the facts. 

In my eyes MODI is not the answer for us Indians, someone like Kejriwal is. He is one of us and we can prove our democracy only by electing a leader who is one of us.

That being said, why the fuck BJP now pretending that they care for Advani? Why can't their spokesperson go upfront in public and tell that Advani is an idiot and they have laid him off?

- **Ban Petrol/Diesel Vehicles for a Fossil Fuel free future!** Almost all terrorist activities use petrol or diesel cars and bikes. This is a brilliant anti-terror move! Let's make India the first country to use only renewable energy based transportation.

- **Ban shock-absorbers for remaining vehicles to make Indian roads pothole-free!** If shock-absorbers are not present, citizens would automatically demand timely repair of roads. Thus pothole problem will be completely solved in a matter of months. This is a surgical strike on every pothole in our country!

- **Ban smoke masks or other artificial breathing devices to make pollution-less cities!** Due to over-use of such masks by children, elderly and others, we are not fixing the root of the problem - air! By adopting this initially painful move, we can slowly evolve to have respiratory systems that can breathe in a toxic atmosphere. This can cause inconveniences to some who might not evolve.

(more explanation inside, long post)",0,3q0x25,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3q0x25/people_who_oppose_beef_ban_would_you_eat_a_human/,102,"People who say that we should be free to eat whatever we like, let's say that government allows eating meat of humans that are raised like livestock, people whose mental abilities are below an average human, people who have been raised like livestock since the day they were born. This is a purely hypothetical situation and you can argue that this would never happen. But if it did, would you eat human meat that was advertised in such a way that it made you think more about how delicious it would be as opposed to how it was raised or killed for that matter. 

Please remember that I've nothing against people who oppose meat ban. It's just that I normally see argument against beef ban supporters like, if you want to ban eating beef, why not meat and chicken too ? And if you're banning meat, why not ban eating plants too, as they are living beings and they can feel to ? I've no argument against this statement. 

You can say that even if the human I'm talking about is close to an animal, it would still feel the same feelings that we do, albeit crudely. Also, you can say that it would be difficult to watch something that looks so much like a human, to be killed right in front of your eyes in shops that sell fresh meat. 

You might not agree with this, but I think cows and humans or other animals feel the same basic feelings. I personally think that although humans have a really advanced brain, they can do things that animals might never be able to. Also, we can ask questions about ourselves, our existence, we have free will. I'm sorry if I missed any other important things that we humans can do. But I think, at the end it all boils down to eating, sleeping, sex, excretion and other basic processes. Of course this is a really stupid generalization as I am basically summarising the entire heap of human achievements in a mere one line. 

I personally think that we should be free to eat whatever we like, because we basically rule the world. When I say we rule the world, I mean that we are the most dominant race out of all living beings. You can argue that, deadly virus or bacteria would be a good candidate too, so let's say that we are one of the most powerful races of living beings. Even if people argue that eating beef, or meat is morally wrong, what is right and what is wrong is subjective. So, eating beef or meat is a choice of the individual. 

Some world governments have declared some species as protected and you cannot kill them because they are on verge of extinction and they are important part of the food pyramid. Wiping them out of the face of Earth would been disruption in the food chain and other effects on the environment. So, basically you cannot kill some species even if they are pretty dangerous to deal with like, tigers, lions and other carnivore animals. Their numbers are pretty small in size, so they can't do much anyway, although there are exceptions like tigers attacking tribal people living in the area. 

This further reaffirms the fact that we humans can do whatever we want. Since cows, pigs and other livestock are available in abundance, there won't be any environmental impact and we can kill as many as we want. But, what would we do if there was a hypothetical situation where humans that I described before were a part of livestock too ? Would we eat them too ? What would happen if someday the livestock we've been killing since thousands of years turn intelligent and do the same thing to us ? What would be our thoughts when another dominant race comes in and starts killing us for food and we can't do anything about it ? Would our feelings be the same as the thousands of cows, pigs and chickens we kill everyday for food ? Would we feel the same way on the verge of death as those animals do ? A lot of these situations are pretty hypothetical and stupid what-if situations which might never happen. But the purpose of these questions was to know what you think.

I'm very sorry if this question is offensive to you. I had this questions bugging me since quite some time and I wanted to know your opinion or thoughts. If anything I said sounds stupid, please excuse my stupidity. I think I might be biased at some points, so please take what I wrote with a grain of salt. And thank you for reading this wall of text.

So please read to the end, I promise it will be worth it.

To start off, India is in a shitty situation wrt Pakistan. One of the main reasons is, we are in a position where we cannot use our vast superiority in conventional weapons/military. It is very dangerous and almost impossible to have a limited scope conventional battle between 2 nuclear powers.
It is very easy for it to escalate into a nuclear war.

For people who want a lot more detailed version of this post, take a look at this MIT lecuture on India-Pakistan clusterfuck. Start at 35mins if you want to skip details about nuclear weapons in general
http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-8-004-reducing-the-danger-of-nuclear-weapons-and-proliferation-january-iap-2015/videos/lecture-1-south-asia-under-the-shadow-of-nuclear-weapons/

This is one of the most unbiased sources you will find. It is given by an Indian/ABCD prof Vipin and you will see that it is relatively unbiased. No professor, TV channel in India will have the balls to look at things this objectively.

1971 war was pretty bad on Pakistan and they were not ready to lose a conventional battle to India again. Indira Gandhi tested a nuclear device, which is technically not a bomb, was dubbed as nuclear explosion for peaceful purposes. World bought it to a certain extent except Pakistan, 
where the famous words ""we will eat grass, but we will get nuclear weapons too"". But ours was not a bomb. It was a bulky, almost 2x the size of a car, which could never be mounted on a plane/missile.

Then Narasimha Rao's government was very close to testing the weapon and declaring India as a nuclear state. Till then India was not a official nuclear state so the world was unsure. Thanks to pressure from US, they did not test it.

Enter BJP, they even had it in their manifesto that they will test it. They made it an issue of national pride, almost saying the congress govt was afraid of the 'west'. This issue became a big deal, got politicized and was made a matter of nationalism and the leaders did not really grasp the scale of what they were talking about.
Basically doing anything to win the election.

Then comes the test in 1998 tests. India proudly announced to the world effectively that they were a nuclear state. Nationalism and chest thumping everywhere. 2 weeks later Pakistan did it too. This changed the equation between India and Pakistan forever.

Why?
It is almost like Pakistan was baiting India. Both countries had been working on the weapons since the 1970s test and were waiting for each other to test it. Because the country that tests first will face the international ire, sanctions and second country gets to say ""they did it.we are doing it for self defense""
I am sure Pakistan was hoping India would test it, because once India tests and makes it legitimate that they are a nuclear country, Pakistan can do it too and announce they are a nuclear country too. This erased India's conventional military superiority advantage overnight.
All because some retarded overly nationalistic leaders put it in their manifesto.

What could India have done? It could have developed it, kept the world guessing if it had the weapons. Unofficially all countries knew India had the weapons and yes, China would not have messed with India because even though India say they dont have it, China knows India does. They would not have taken that chance.
How does it help with Pakistan? Because both sides are publicly saying they dont have nuclear weapons, say India wanted to enter pakistan and destroy a few terror camps. India could have used its conventional army and done that. Its like 2 card players hiding their best cards and holding on to it, bluffing that they dont have it while both sides know they do.
India folded first and showed its cards. India could always use its conventional army for limited scale objective missions. Pakistan would be in a position where they cannot use their weapons unless India went all in, trying to invade all the way to Islamabad, then all bets were off.

Now, Pakistan says ""any missile fired from Indian side, we automatically assume that it is a nuclear weapon and will respond with a nuclear weapon.""

Because they are technically right. India is a self certified nuclear state and they cant risk a single missile landing there, wait for it to explode and see if that was 
a nuclear weapon and then respond. So now, even a single missile fired towards paksitan will get a nuclear response from them and so India's hands are tied.

Pakistan knows this and started testing India's patience. Kargil in 2001, Parliament attack in 2002 and several others all the way to Mumbai. It is no coincidence that attacks from Pakistan suddenly increased after 2000. Pakistan must have been laughing loudly when these happened because we could not do squat. Why? we both legitimized our nuclear weapons and our conventional army is tied up. 
If we had maintained we did not, but developed it secretly and kept it, it would have left them guessing. An attack happens on the parliament? retaliate with conventional army. Nuclear? what nuclear? we keep saying ""we dont have nuclear weapons"" and continue with conventional battle. Pakistan cant use their nuclear weapons too.
But in our present case, one Indian army bomber crosses into Pakistan, all they need to do is ""their bomber is here to drop nuclear weapons, we cant wait and see what it is. we retaliate""

BJP's over nationalism basically fucked up the situation.

Same happening all over again with Balochistan. That was our trump card. Entire world knows we are involved there but we kept denying it as no official announced that we are. Pakistan just kept crying that we are and world did not know what to do. Who were we kidding when we built 6 ""embassies"" in afghnistan. Why do we need that many there?
We are second biggest donors for Afghanistan after US. Whole world knows whats happening and they kept quiet and Pakistan was the only one complaining. Then comes Modi announcing it to the world, to make his supporters at home feel like we are actually doing something when the govt is getting humiliated in Kashmir.
What changed now? Not a damn thing in Balochistan, we were involved before, will be involved in the future. The only difference is, now Pakistan has an official statement from our PM to point to, when any terror attack happens related to Balochistan. Pakistan-China economic corridor passes right through, China knew India 
was involved in derailing attempts, now our great PM made it official. China now is openly saying ""India is derailing our economic projects there. Your PM just said it!"" We have effectively legitimized their support of terror in Kashmir because our PM openly said we are supporting inside their country! I just cannot believe what a reckless move that was 

I am scared at what this blind nationalism will lead to. BJP is a different kind of poison.

My argument: Modi is the prime minister of INDIA, and by virtue of being the PM, its leader.

When Modi meets Obama, he meets it as a representative and a leader of ALL Indian people

And as the leader of India, whatever happens in India is HIS responsibility.

Just like if your younger brother breaks the neighbor's window, your dad owns up, apologizes and pays the neighbor. Not your brother, not your chacha, but the 'leader' of the household - the dad

People have called Modi a ""CEO"" style PM. Well, when a company underperforms, it is the CEO's duty to own up and lead, not blame the CFO - at least not in public.

We Indians have already gone through 10 years of a PM who wouldnt stand up when we had problems. We didnt want 5 more years of the same. Whether it is Dadri, or Lalitgate, or Vyapam, Modi has to stand up and say that ""I am responsible. I will take care of it"".

It is established within the SIT report that there was enough reasons to criticize him and that not criticizing him would have amounted to an absolute failure of the media.

1181,[P] The Cult of Modi - understanding the rise of India-Purusha Narendra,7,5yx79w,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5yx79w/p_the_cult_of_modi_understanding_the_rise_of/,56,"Remember India is Indira, Indira is India? Modi, like a lot of his ideas, has borrowed and reinvented it into - support for Modi, is support for India. 

This is incredibly influential on you if you believe in it, and mindboggling if you don't - so, a classic cult. But politics in India has been like that for a long time, since Mahatma Gandhi, so let's not talk about that. But a few points on the appeal of the India-Purusha Narendra Modi - the man who is India, for his supporters. Why is his cult as it is?

I have three reasons.

One, genuine anti-incumbency. This is still a thing - look at Punjab, Goa, Delhi, et al. There is still huge negativity regarding how government functions, regardless of party, and generally people still vote against parties to show their frustration. 

Two, genuine solutions based politics. Now, India-Purusha's solutions are often seen as rudimentary and simplistic by those with higher proficiency in policy analysis. But that's not his target. Jaitley deals with that through his lawyerly dark arts. Modi offers simple, direct and immediate solutions to what we can call the 'nouveau literate' - segments of the citizenry which is newly literate, especially in IT, who can understand information from different sources, especially Social Media, but are still not proficient enough to dig deeper and do critical analysis. This allows India-Purusha to selectively feed information, and then provide simple solutions, emerging as the saviour/champion.

Three, consolidation of Hindu vote bank. For a long time Hindu votes have been fragmented by caste, India-Purusha has the genuine ability to unite Hindus despite caste. Now, most times, this is unity against Muslims, building on point one, using point two, but he is a genuine mass leader, like Indira, like Nehru.

This is a new era of politics, our old formulas don't work. The question is, is this a permanent change or the consequences of a single man's rise to power. Only time will tell. It's too soon anyway to talk of a post-Modi era, because India-Purusha is, right now, only beginning.

We must all get used to hearing Har Har Modi and Namo, Namo for a long time yet.

Edit: A clarification regarding the concept of 'nouveau literate' - I don't imply this to be a class specific category. It applies to two main sections of society - across caste, class, region etc. One, young voters, especially those who became politically active because of Modi from UPA's latter years. Two, older voters who're just beginning to use Facebook, WhatsApp etc. and who generally rely on this for information. Again, this is not a class specific thing.",Politics

Others claim that Hindus are supporting TTP. They want missiles fired into Afghanistan, attacks on assumed TTP offices there. They want reciprocal attacks in India.

I have this perception that MSM (mainstream media) has generally negative views of current central govt so for past one month, I have stopped following MSM and deactivated my Twitter account. On twitter there seems to be either a civil war b/w liberal/left/RW or lame jokes by stand up comedians.

The only thing I have been reading now is Business Standard which mostly maintains neutral standpoint since majority of the news is just market reports or/and policy framework of govt.

But here too, have been seeing loads of vomits of Modiji in foreign land and I swear to god, I'm getting sick to my stomach. [For instance look at this](http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/modi-promises-reforms-with-speed-and-boldness-115112100641_1.html)

* I dont understand why the fuck is he promising reforms with speed, why the fuck not sit your ass and do whatever the fuck is necessary. By giving a credit line of USD 1 billion, he thinks that he is statesman. Instead he sounds like a paid clown. China can just piss USD 10 billion like that. Why the fuck always compare yourself with China when you don't have much oxygen in your lungs.


* Madarchod, there has been hardly any motherfucking so-called reforms. Instead, budget of social welfare NAREGA has gone up. India has moved just 4 motherfuckin points in WEF' Ease of Doing Bussiness and this 4 point is because of improvement in power generation.

* There are plenty of low-hanging fruits for Mr. Modi which do not require parliament legislation. For starters he can sell sick PSUs like Air India/MTNL/HMT etc among others. But there has been only talks of their sale. Isn't minimum govt means not getting into business. Instead no, this lodu govt is instead regulating the Air fairs. **Marx & Lenin must be rolling in their graves when people call this govt right-wing**. That's the reason I respect left wing more than right wing. At least, left wing has philosophical clarity.

* Tell me who the fuck thinks India is growing ~~fastest~~ 7.5% per annum. If you look at the data, major indicators either shows stagnation or downward spiral. Private investment has actually gone down. Public investment has gone up. Just by changing calculation method, your GDP doesnt start growing overnight.

* Mr Modi has been extremely lucky that he took over when commodity & oil prices have been historically lower. In such a condition, it's quite easier to push difficult reforms but he wasted 19 months like that. **Even infamous UPA2 had balls to let the govt fall for the sake of India-US nuclear deal, this govt seems to have no balls**

* Mr Shourie had advised govt to pass the buck of land-reforms to state govt and instead focus on GST, labor & corporate laws. But Modi picked dumbfuck like Jaitley who acts like a lawyer. Govt could have easily passed GST & labor laws in 1st year itself but dint show any urge and now they have lost the momentum. Opposition has become stronger, now they would have to suck dicks to pass shit.

* Look at the education sector. How the fuck can we grow @10% with an unskilled & uneducated masses. This Irani is out to fuck everyone of us. No vision so far. **Instead filled all important education vacancies with RSS thugs. My problem is not installing RSS sympathisers but rather choosing losers who have no merit. COuld not she have chosen Anupam Kher instead of Gajendra Chauhan**. At least congress  chose Congress sympathisers for such posts who were a bit qualified.

* ** See the irony, Mr Modi talks about iPhones & Android when in reality every 4th girl of his country if bloody illiterate**. Madarchod, Facebook/twitter apni gaand me daal lo when every 4th woman of your country is illiterate.

* **This govt was supposed to be about minimum govt maximum governance but they imposed cess for Swachh Bharat**. Any sane person would have rather rationalized the existing tax regime and make it more transparent. But no, lets put some more tax and fuck formal sector employees in the ass.

There have been some reforms in power, infra & railway sector but that's that. These ministers are competent but they can't achieve much without over-arching reforms.


**I'm sorry for the rant but it hurts to see the daily chutiyaps of political brass when your country is going to shit every passing day. IF India wants to develop and feed its people, there is no right time like this. This opportunity can't be missed. Oil & commodities prices are lower, govt is in majority in Loksabha. It should persuade other parties and pass important reforms. There are more hungry people in india than whole Africa, we badly need progress**.

A country that till 18 months ago, was blessed with perfect communal harmony, the country that enjoyed an absolute freedom of expression, the country that had not banned a single book, movie or play. 

No one had heard of the word ‘caste’ in my India and the word ‘religion’ either. There was no hunger, nor there was poverty. All the farmers were billionaires so no one ever committed suicide. It was a wonderful country where people could eat as much beef they wanted, anywhere they wanted. There were no laws banning cow slaughter in any state. No one had heard of words like corruption, murders and rape. 

Communal violence and riots were unheard of. The years 1947 and 1984 skipped India, therefore there were no such things as partition riots and anti-Sikh riots. The year 2002 however did happen in a terrible place called Gujarat, the single stain on the spotless secular fabric of India! Kashmiri Pandits lived in the valley in peace and harmony with their neighbours. The ethnic cleansing of the valley never happened. Serial bomb blasts and terrorist attacks were also terms that did not exist. 

Indians did not know what unhappiness or poverty or suffering meant. If they wanted to experience it, they would go on a conducted tour to Sudan or Palestine!

Such was the paradise that was my India!

Unfortunately, the good run did not last. 

16th May 2014, I still remember that dark day - the day Fascist Patriarchal Hindu Male Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister! 

That was the day India saw poverty, communal violence, law and order issues, farmer suicides, caste discrimination, gender discrimination, murders, rape, tax avoidance, spitting on the roads, litter in the streets, road rage and every other social evil that you can think of, for the very first time!! 

Thanks to this evil guy Modi, communal violence has crossed all limits. Every day millions of people are being massacred in India. At this rate, there will be no voters left to cast their vote in 2019! 

Some eminent historians and liberal thinkers have compared this regime to the Taliban - that social organisation formed by terrorists with no religion. The Taliban however is so hurt with this comparison that it wants Arvind Kejriwal to hold a dharna on its behalf!

We enlightened citizens know that oPM Modi is PERSONALLY responsible for everything from our constipation to clogged toilets at a railway station. I am upset that Modi has NOT issued a statement yet on why there are paan stains on the staircase leading to my building. Everything that is wrong in this country is the PM’s fault. NO ONE else is to be blamed. 

Oh my poor poor India! What have you done to deserve this? I need to find a suitable award to return to protest against this. 

I hope this Modi resigns soon and we liberal intellectuals can return to the perfect Utopian paradise that was India under the great leadership of intellectual icon, Rahul Gandhi!

Many of you will say that this is because porn is banned and suddenly I am losing my shit. That is the tiny percent of it. I am mad because this clear violation of freedom. 

They felt fit so they banned beef, banning of documentary, etc. It's like your entire party is obsessed with pushing there own cultures down our throats. Even I am hindu but I don't care if somebody else eats beef or parties or watches porn. 

How the fuck does it affect me or you? 
If you're argument is that porn encourages rape, so think about this for a second, porn releases sexual tension that otherwise was not possible. In hindi if I tell you it's tharak nikalna. It helps keep the mental state normal. 

Infact by banning porn you have just helped multiply prostitution industry. You have heard of prostitution industry right? The industry because of which many young girls are kidnapped. 

Forget how you think this will improve anything, because lets be honest you haven't even blocked the ones I goto. Just the ones commercially famous. Why did you block liveleak I will never understand. 

Lets look at the main point that you guys have decided to turn this country into your own agenda. If I were to give examples can I say Taliban, Saudi or ISIS? 

They are also too obsessed with keeping there culture close to there hearts and halting progress as much as possible. You certainly are on the right track with this. 

Many are not even realizing how slowly and steadily you are taking away freedoms and before anyone will ever realize there would be nothing left to go back to.

We should all know by now even if India accounted for the massive under reporting of rape we would still not even make the top 20 countries for rape per capita. Rape is an epidemic worldwide, it happens in all corners and all forms. 

And yet in western media narrative India is singled out as to make it seem we hold the exclusive rights to rape.

The problem with the Delhi rape was the manner in which it occurred and gruesomeness of it, which of course became free fodder for a western media already foaming at the mouth. But surely we don't believe that this was any worse the case of say Elizabeth Fritzl where the woman was held for over 20 years and raped while being held in a dungeon or  the case John Jamelske a serial rapist and murder . Yet we never saw a documentary or an outcry of rapes in America. Am I  excusing what happened certainly not. But surely it doesn't take a genius to recognise that the topic of rape and has somehow become the raison d'etre of the western media's narrative on India.

A place where men apparently can't control themselves. 

Of course knowing the history of western mainstream media we would know why this happens . 

It simply goes to a little book called Manufacturing consent by Noam Chomsky.

Do we ever hear about epidemic of rape in Australia or Sweden where there is the highest rape per capita in the world? Or did anyone make a documentary about these countries no. We are constantly led to believe western countries especially US and England are somehow places of upotpia whose citizens and governments can do no wrong ; despite Americans being responsible for the biggest genocide in the 21st century we in no way conflate Americans with murder. And yet somehow we a narrative continues that India and Indian men are rapists. 

But this is what they do they tell us Russia is bad and out to take over Ukraine despite the West being responsible for over throwing a sovereign Ukrainian government . They tell us the Chinese are aggressive and convince us we must join to stop this future world menace by surrounding them. Or the latest documentary which paints China as ignorant of the pleas of its people polluting them to their deaths despite every western nation having gone through the same process.

We saw a article in the economist which had no real substance but continously ranted about how India is somehow responsible for all the ills in cricket.

Am I saying India doesn't have problems . No. But this is what they do .

Surely at some point Indians will recognise that this is what the western media do . They manufacture consent. They continously drum through narrative . Narrative which is repeated enough times may actually cause their target audience to believe it to be true. In the 80's it was the USSR is bad and open up your economies and take IMF loans. 

Today its India is a land of rapists.

At some point we are going to have to stop taking the bait, or believe in the belittling that is constantly drummed out by a hemisphere which loses its influence everyday . We are going to have learn how to take a step back and say thanks but no thanks .

**Therefore I look through Reddit India or facebook I see more and more people saying these people do shame upon us that its hard to be an Indian in this moment, I ask you why? What justice do we do ourselves by accepting that the words of two individuals represent the republic and its citizenry? Are we so drummed out at that we have too somehow come to accept this narrative? If that be so shame it would be**",Non-Political

**Maybe this perfectly explains how British have been able to rule and loot India for 200 years**

edit: down voting? you don't understand the point i'm making about how elites in India care and love something very little foreign more than their own fellow citizens.

**Fact #1: The author has presented a study which points at lower number of communal violence in *Uttar Pradesh* in 2014, compared to 2013.**

> As summarised here, there were 668, 823, and 644 incidents of communal violence nationwide in the years 2012, 2013, and 2014 respectively.

People here have been complaining constantly that the U.P. state government is accountable for ALL communal incidents in Uttar Pradesh, including Dadri. Now it turns out that that the violence has reduced..... Thank you Mudi?? Wtf??

**Fact #2: There is another study pointed out in the article which asserted that communal violence increased by nearly 25% in the first five months of 2015 under the Modi government.**

> The actual raw numbers are 287 incidents in January-May 2015 as against 232 incidents in the corresponding period 2014.

But the author has preemptively dismissed that study because **""there’s a relatively small absolute difference between the two numbers"" and ""there’s no way to know if the difference is statistically significant, the larger point is that by comparing any two arbitrary time periods, one can get just about any result you want.""**

First of all 25% is NOT ""relatively small absolute difference"". No way.

Second of all, what is this: ""comparing any two arbitrary time periods, one can get just about any result you want""???

She Literally JUST compared two arbitrary time periods for U.P. , i.e., 2013 and 2014 to conclude that communal violence has reduced. **So, she got the result she wants, and now other results are pointless?**

There were 2 fuckfaces interviewing me: one a Bihari Math Professor who probably knows about 50 words in English, and a mallu man, whose wife probably fucks guys half her age in shitty blue films: hence, the reason why he had a perpetually frowning face.
I smiled and politely wished them, ""Good morning, sir"", twice, since there were two of them. But they didn't even look up! They just said, ""take a seat quickly."" I smiled and controlled my anger. They then asked me the usuals: where does your dad work, what does your mom do et cetera. They then looked at my 10th and 11th report card (i had scored 90 per cent in tenth ICSE, but my percentage dipped to 76 per cent,due to my bitch of a math teacher in my school, who couldn't teach math AT ALL, while I had an average of around 84 per cent, amongst the other subjects. I'm in ISC, by the way) and asked me, ""bhy did urr perchentage diph?"", To which I gave a shitty reply: something something I didn't put enough hard work, I have improved in twelfth grade something something (I really did improve in twelfth grade, I had an average of 83 per cent in my second preboards). There was an awkward silence for about 10 seconds. The mallu then asked me, "" white waere you at sent for yoour first semester exams?"". I was admitted to the hospital during this period for about 5 days, and was bedridden for nearly a month. I told them this. They thought I was lying. 

Fuckers. 

Anyway, the mallu mone asked me what my favourite subject was in economics. I replied: Keynesian economics. I said that Keynesian economics is ideally what economics must choose to achieve: to maximise human welfare. The cunt must've felt overwhelmed by my response. He then begins asking me technical questions. The fucker thought that I didn't know the answer to textbook questions and definitions. Boy was he wrong. 
Once the mallu ran out of questions, the Bihari Math cunt pounced in with the stupidest question: ""bhat is the dephinisun opf determinants?"" 

What. The. Fuck.

Who the FUCK KNOWS. It's a bunch of numbers with 2 lines on the sides. I said I didn't know the definition. The Bihari fuck wasn't that bad though, to be honest: his questions were all right.

One of my dad's friends, whose daughter studies in Christ, told me that their strict dress code was understandable: it instils discipline, he said. REALLY? NOT BEING ALLOWED TO ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES? IS THAT REALLY DISCIPLINE?

After ALL THIS, I found out later that night, that I did not get into that shit hole. I also found it that a guy who scored 53 per cent got in. I lost my shit after hearing that.

Look at what happened to ""Secularism"". Political groups used this legitimate issue and spun it into a guilt trip against their rivals. It may lead to a few electoral gains in the short run but over the long run, it leads to a massive under-current of resentment and a vicious backlash. Today, ""secularism"" is a joke in the Indian political discourse. ""True"" seculars are now begging people to forget all the propaganda in the name of secularism and revert back to its original nature.

Now these same elements (who ruined secularism) are trying to spin another legitimate issue (women's issues) into a guilt trip.

Just take a look at this article: [Women in India Aren’t Safe on Twitter Either: The sexual humiliation of the streets has moved online](https://medium.com/matter/no-safe-places-d59af0c3ba58).

This article is a joke. 

> These days, though, nowhere is protected: some Indian men are determined to use the web to target women whose opinions they hate or fear. And, just like street hoodlums, they employ a mob mentality, work in packs, and deploy sexual language to terrorize and humiliate women.

.

> It’s clear from their online behavior that these men are largely privileged Hindus, many of whom live outside India and enjoy well-paying jobs. Prominent political journalist Sagarika Ghose, who has 361,000 followers on Twitter, calls them “communal techies.” She also coined the now-ubiquitous term “Internet Hindu” in a reference to their infatuation with the Hindu right wing nationalist ideology of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which won an overwhelming majority in the general elections that were held in April. The Hindu far right is famously patriarchal, and blind to the humanity and individuality of women.

.

> Take poet and novelist Meena Kandasamy. She writes about sexuality with a rare frankness, has over 25,000 followers on Twitter, and is a regular target of abuse. Speaking to me from Chennai, she said that the particular vulgarity of the tweets she is subjected to is influenced by the fact that she belongs to a low caste.

.

> “They want to frighten me off Twitter,” she told me. “They want me in a subjugated role.” **Top lel**

.

> The fact that a low caste woman could be seen as successful, not just by the standards of her community, but by the intellectual mainstream, is galling to caste-obsessed right-wing Hindu men. **ROTFLing @ her wishful fantasies**

.

> Sagarika Ghose, despite the fact that she has a TV show and a newspaper column where she can publicly call out abusers if she chooses to. “I regularly receive rape threats,” she told me. “I’m regularly called a whore and a slut who sleeps with “Congi” (Congress) politicians and every day my timeline is filled with abuses like ‘ass licker,’ ‘slave,’ and ‘Congress sepoy’ [foot soldier].” **What did she expect? People will thank her for calling them Nazis and murderers? Lulz**

> Ghose shrugs off the abuse. “They’re playing out some perverse patriarchal fantasies of dominating strong women.”

> Though right-wing Hindu men seem to be the majority of abusers on Twitter, just as they are the majority of people on the ground in India, their tweets suggest a profound sense of victimization. They portray themselves as a sort of endangered species whose survival depends on extinguishing, if only verbally, the people who are different from them. **Can't you see the hilariously transparent agenda of the article? Lulz**

> Not all women have suffered the onslaught. Right-wing women are protected from the abuse, earning relative freedom by prodding liberal women—even those who don’t follow them or even know who they are—in growling packs, attacking them like some children strike animals with sticks and stones. **There you go. Its not about women. Its about these phony left-wing propaganda machines getting as good as they give.**

This is nothing but a bunch of left-wing moonbats engaging in a cringeworthy display of attacking the Indian voters who just handed them a historic electoral spanking. 

This is pure desperation. This is comic relief.

For better or for worse, we no longer live in an era of uni-directional media. The likes of Roy, Ghose, etc can no longer get away by calling people ""Nazis"", ""genocidal maniacs"", and ""murderers"" without getting a few choice abuses returned by the targets of their vicious propaganda.

And when people return their compliments, they go whining about MUH PATRIARCHY, MUH HINDOOO-RIGHT-WING. LOL. Do you see how pathetically hilarious this is?

Also, consider [this reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/28msnd/the_sexual_humiliation_of_the_streets_has_moved/) by a well known left winger.

The thread attempts to use this joke of an article to go on a guilt trip about women's issues.  

Don't attempt to spin an electoral defeat into guilt trips, you'll end up making women's issues into a joke. Just like ""secularism"" has become a joke.

I have observed that the thought analyses of so called educated Indians is far less than Americans. I am beginning to wonder if we have lesser IQ(currently). My theory is stemmed from the following :

1. We never came out of our communal sentiments (caste based) even though we are aware it is all nonsense . We never even try to address it within ourselves nor we read extensively about its origins in school. Most general population never wonder why do we have ""classes"" within the same race? It is peculiar that communal sentiment is stronger than National sentiment. People actively participate in these sentiments.
2. We submit too much to ""gurus"" without making thorough investigation of them. We support their pseudo science because it protects our insecurities . We are fine with them occupying lands, controlling wealth , preaching enormous ignorance . They give lame explanations of effect of Saturn on some temples and why women should don't enter them. We never question the science behind it.
3. Our theatre arts (cinema ) is at its worst. We are such snowflakes that directors lives are threatened if they take movies that ""hurt"" communal sentiments. We don't want to hear truths . Or alt least look at it and judge it ourselves without making a huge political stunts. And unfortunately people support it. They have to always distort the truth to please the audience. What kind of cowardice is that? What's the purpose of the art?
4. There are no Science-fiction movies that can be thoughtful...like Inception, Martian or Interstallar . Most Indians don't even discuss these movies, let alone produce them. I wonder how much of our population even understand them or want to watch them?
5. We read more of current day to day politics than any other books out there. Never try to understand to go and think beyond. There is more interest in vanity (flaunting their cars, assets ) than acquiring knowledge.
6. Very egoistic and arrogant  but surprisingly devotees of either politicians , gurus or heroes. Their bhakti is unmatched to any other world .
7. They hesitate to question anything ancient and sacred. Lack of analytical skills?....
8. Our politicians represent our moral sense and values.
9. They believe that being educated is reading bunch class text books and ace the exams. Parents are extremely proud of their kids achievements and very ashamed of those who are academically backward( I mean those who can't boring drill for hours??)
10. They don't even read  their scriptures but have a very high feeling of them. The question is they don't read but yet they feel proud of it..
11. The list goes on.................",AskIndia

Please let's have a respectful debate. Don't be abusive.  

[EDIT] If your answer is just Modi. Don't you think you need serious introspection 

[EDIT] Reason to support BJP ? 

Findings from people's comment

* Most of the people supporting BJP because of Modi and Modi alone. They don't even care if anythings else exist in BJP or not. 

* People choosing BJP because they think BJP is less shittiest of all the parties.

* Transparency does not matter to them. They think Modi is icon of development and no matter how BJP gets money or conduct it's businesses, Modi will do the development because he can do the development. 
 

* Lot of Indians give everyone at least one chance to pull us out of our misery. Right now, Modi's got the best shot at doing something.

*  Some very optimistic and faithfull supporters even said this 
>I am supporting BJP because I am able to trust them even though they are not disclosing their party funding.
Even in an implausible worst case scenario, if their funding comes from immoral businessmen, corrupt foreigners or religious fanatics, I am able to trust how uninfluenced they are regarding the source of money.

Honestly I can see only negative connotation in all the reasons given to chose BJP, that may be because I am disillusioned by parties actions but again I had said it earlier I am unable to trust it and I am still not convinced that why I should vote for BJP. But thank you guys for giving your side of story it may change the judgement of some other disillusioned voter even though it didn.t mine.

I was back for my vacation with the wife and kids. We went to a park one morning at about 9am since the kids were restless(3 and 1.5 yrs). 

Wife was wearing a short dress but since we were heading to a public place put on some shorts to cover her legs till the knees. She is white by the way.

So here we were walking through the park with the kids and men, not just a minority but the majority there were literally raping her with their looks.

Some even were bold enough to walk up close and say some shit, mostly in Hindi.

This was the first time I saw this and experienced this. My wife is used to people looking at her and it does not bother her at all. But this made her, and me, so fucking uncomfortable that we left immediately.

It felt like at anytime they may attack us... Can you imagine that shit... In Chennai... At the bloody Ana nagar tower park... Wtf. I grew up in this city.

I'm mighty glad I don't have to raise my daughter in my fucked up country. We are just too far off the deep end folks.

1325,[NP] For Guy Virgins: Basic Things No One Told Me About Sex,37,3l9gb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3l9gb3/np_for_guy_virgins_basic_things_no_one_told_me/,41,"I lost my virginity later than the average guy. Before I got laid for the first time I had read a fair amount about sex. I took Sex Education classes in school. I read articles on positions and techniques in Maxim and Cosmo. I read sites like www.sexuality.org. I read the Savage Love column every week. I also looked at tons of porn on the internet and through my PlayStation 2's handy DVD player. All in all, I thought even though I had never done it myself, I knew most of what there was to know about sex.

&nbsp;

Then I started having it and I kept discovering all these basic things that had somehow passed me by. In all the stuff I read and watched these things never came up. I never heard anyone talking about them either. I guess they assumed that the audience was already having sex and that knowing these things was a given. And it seems that porn glosses some things over or does not reflect what actual sex is like. I know, I'm as shocked as you are. So here's my list of basic sexual stuff that I only found out about when I came across it myself.

&nbsp;

Hopefully reading this will make life easier for the virgins out there in some way, you know, by lessening that fear of the unknown or whatever. I think the most common theme below is that sex is not as glamorous as it's sometimes made out to be. However, 'not glamorous' isn't the same as 'not enjoyable'. Sex is awesome. If anything, all the little quirks I'll mention below make it more fun.

&nbsp;

**Positions**

&nbsp;

From reading and watching porn I thought positions like missionary, doggy style, woman-on-top, etc. were simple, cut-and-dry things. I soon found out that each one has tons of subtle variations based on things like how you position your legs, the position of her legs, how deep inside her you are in a resting position, the angle you're thrusting in, the position of your upper body, how high or low your hips are on her body, how your bodies fit together, and so on and so on.

&nbsp;

With some variations her vagina will seem like a straight tunnel that you can easily go in-and-out, in-and-out of. With other variations you're mostly inside her, can only thrust a little, and you're more grinding pelvises together.  

For example, if you're in the missionary position:

* If you put your legs together and straight back, you'll get a different feeling then if you had them spread out to your sides and had your knees further up on the bed.
* If she spreads her legs you'll be able to thrust in one way. If she lifts them up and wraps them behind your back, you'll be able to thrust deeper.
* If you rest on your elbows you'll enter her at one angle and be able to thrust in a certain way. If you straighten your arms and rest on your hands you'll thrust at a different angle.
* If the top of your hip bone roughly matches up with hers you'll get a certain angle and depth. If you try to 'ride higher' you'll get a different angle and depth.
* If your upper body is parallel to hers things'll go one way. If you raise your torso up to around 45 degrees things'll be slightly different.
* What works one way with a petite girl may not feel the same with a girl who's closer to your height.
* The idea is you have to play around with these variations in position to find a way that feels good for both of you (or just you if you're selfish).

&nbsp;

**Vaginal lubrication**

You probably know that the vagina secretes a natural lubricant and that women get 'wet'. I knew that basic fact too, but I learned some more things about the process firsthand.

&nbsp;

* It runs out at some point and she'll get dry, and eventually uncomfortable, during sex. Sometimes you have to pull out and apply some lube. At other times you can keep going for a bit and she'll get wet again.
* If the girl gets too wet during sex it can reduce the friction to the point where you don't really feel anything. If she's too dry it doesn't feel that great for you either.
* If enough of it accumulates it has a whitish, mayonnaise look to it. Sometimes you'll finish having sex and when you pull out and look down you'll see a big drop of it running down between her legs.
* If you're going at in the missionary position, it may run out on to the bed and leave a wet spot on the sheets that's a bit white when it dries.

&nbsp;

**Erections**

If you watch porn you may wonder why the guy's erection is sometimes slow to grow. You're thinking that if you were in his shoes you'd be as hard as a rock in a second.

&nbsp;

* Nope, the same thing will happen to you. Once the intial thrill of hooking up with this girl/girls in general wears off, your erection will often start to get soft when your penis isn't being directly stimulated.
* Being drunk, being distracted, and bad technique on the girl's part can contribute to your not getting it up quickly.
* After putting on a condom you may need to jerk yourself off for a second to get it a bit harder before you stick it in her.
* If it's not hard enough you'll have a hard time putting it in. It'll tend to bend or slide out of the way instead of penetrating. However, if it's slightly soft and you manage to get in it, you can often get it harder quickly once you start thrusting.
* If the sex isn't great and/or you're distracted and/or something messed up happens you may start to go soft once you're inside her.

&nbsp;

**Sticking it in**

You've probably heard jokes about this before. Yep, it can be hard to find the hole. Even if you know where you need to go visually, the vaginal entrance can be smaller and tighter than you think so you may not feel exactly where you need to insert the tip of your penis.

&nbsp;

* With missionary it's fairly obvious where you need to put it, but if you're trying to guide it in blind then it can be awkward.
* With doggy style the hole is further up then you'd think.
* When the girl is on top the angle of her vaginal tunnel can give you problems and you can't really see what you're doing. It's best if she guides it in herself.
* Like I said above, if you're a bit soft then you can have trouble putting it in.
* If you fail to get it in properly your dick will slide somewhere else and may feel like it's in for a second or two.
* All this is more difficult if you have a condom on, as it's harder to feel what you're doing.

&nbsp;

**Climaxing**

You may also watch porn and wonder why the guy sometimes has to jerk off for a few minutes before delivering the money shot. You're thinking if you were in that position you'd pop off no problem.

&nbsp;

* Again, the same thing may happen to you. Sometimes you'll be having sex/getting a blowjob/jerking off and you won't be able to cum. If the stimulation isn't effective it can happen. If you put too much pressure on yourself to orgasm on demand it can happen.
* The more common stereotype is that men finish too quickly and that they have to think about stuff like baseball in order to last any real length of time. But not being able to cum happens too. Not all guys are losers who are done in thirty seconds. Finishing too soon definitely happens, but not every single time.
* In many cases you're not just going to cum instantly as soon as you start pounding away, you have to find the speed, angle, depth, etc. that feels good for you. It's not automatic, just like you can't just masturbate in any random way. You have to do what's effective for you.
* On a related note, women don't always want to have marathon sex sessions. Sometimes they'll get tired of the guy stabbing away endlessly, especially if it's not doing anything for them. Sometimes they'll start to get dry and sore. Sometimes they'll have an orgasm or two and think that's enough. Sometimes they'll just be happy with a good twenty minutes of fun sex and not have any need to go for longer.

&nbsp;

**Minor injuries**

* It can be irritating to your skin when your sweaty pubic hair rubs against hers.
* Someone's hair my get accidentally pulled or caught.
* Someone may clumsily fall over as you're changing positions (e.g., when she's getting off you from being on top, when you try to transition from missionary with you kneeling and her laying down to missionary with both of you laying down).
* You may hit your head against the headboard, har har har.
* When you're going at it missionary style you can end up hitting the bottom of your bladder on her pelvic bone. That gets old after ten minutes...
* Your knees and elbows can get sore after a while from rubbing on the bed/floor/etc.
* During doggy style if you slip out and then accidently thrust back into her pelvis. This can hurt the tip of your dick.
* If she's riding you and you slip out she can come down on your dick. Usually it gets bent a little and hurts for a minute. At the worst you can rupture the tissue and take a trip to the hospital.
* You may get scratches, bruises, pulled hair (purposely this time), and bite marks. That's cool.
* You may fall off the bed or hit your elbow against the wall or something else like that. You just gotta laugh when this shit happen.

&nbsp;

**Condoms**

First let me say that you should always wear these things despite what I say below. You know what can happen if you don't. You may have heard guys complain about condoms, saying they kill the mood or whatever. It's true, they are kind of annoying.

&nbsp;

* They kill spontaneity. You can't smoothly progress from foreplay to sex. You have to stop the action to go grab a condom, open it, and then put it on.
* They smell bad.
* They kill sensation, sometimes to the point where you can barely feel your own dick inside the girl. On the plus side, they can allow you to last longer.
* Sometimes when you're inside the girl they'll bunch up in weird ways and feel strange.
* They interrupt the flow of things after sex is over. You have to pull out, take the condom off, and get rid of it.

&nbsp;

**Messiness**

You probably know this already, but overall sex is messier than what you see on t.v. or in porn.

* You're going to get hot and sweaty of course.
* The woman's lubrication is going to dribble all over the place and possibly stain the sheets. Someone is going to get semen on them at some point. Condom wrappers are going to litter the ground. You may kiss passionately and slobber all over each other.
* Someone may let out a fart right in the middle of things.
* Sometimes when you pull out and she changes positions she'll fart out her vagina (queefing).
* If you finger her your fingers may be covered with a lot of her clear lubricant when you pull them out. You may have to wipe them off on your leg or something. Classy.
* If you have sex when she's on her period, well use your imagination.
* If you have anal sex you may get some poo on your dick.
* If you have a good session, when you're done you're going to be sweaty, red faced, tired, and a bit out of it. Your hair will be messed up, gross stray hairs will be stuck to your skin, the girl will have a bit of white lubricant running out of her cootch. You'll have a bit of cum dribbling out of your dick. There will be at least one condom wrapper on the floor, the sheets and pillows will be all over the place, and the bed will have a wet spot on it. If you cuddle afterwards you'll start to stick together and it'll feel gross when you pull apart. It's great.

&nbsp;

**General differences from masturbation and porn**

If I had to give a simplified summary I'd say masturbating is all about the visuals while actual sex is more about physical feelings. Of course masturbation is about the physical feelings too, but if you're anything like me, the visuals drive the experience and provide most of the excitement. When you're using your imagination you keep flipping between different scenarios until you hit on one that does it for you. When you watch porn you probably skip around between different DVD scenes or online clips until you hit on one that turns you on the most.

&nbsp;

With sex some positions give you something to look at, but you're hardly sitting in a chair watching a scene that has been shot from a distance and angle that gives you a good view. If you're doing a girl in the missionary position you're too close to her to see anything. Your eyes are probably closed, or if they're open they may not be focused on anything. You're probably kissing her or you may have your head nuzzled in her neck. Cut off from the visuals you instead concentrate on the tactile sensations; your dick going in and out of her vagina, your bodies pressed together, her hands scratching your back, her breath on your cheek, how hot you are, the sweat forming on the small of your back, your hands grabbing her boobs, kissing, and various little aches, tired spots, and discomforts. And then there are the sounds and smells; body parts slapping together, her breathing and moaning. The smell of latex, sweat, someone's breath, or her vag.

&nbsp;

Of course, sometimes when you're going at it you'll be picturing things in your head to help yourself get off. Like maybe your girlfriend is going down on you and that feels pretty nice, but not quite perfect, so you imagine a porn scene or hot girl you saw the other day to get yourself over the edge.

&nbsp;

Also, when you watch porn you can mistakingly associate the visual act you're witnessing with the sensations you're giving yourself. For example, say you have a thing for titty fucking scenes in porn. And let's say as you're watching, you're masturbating in a fast, intense manner. You know your body so of course it's going to feel good. But actual titty fucking probably doesn't feel like your fast, intense, just-right wanking. The true physical sensations may or may not be your cup of tea. You may find them too slow or soft for your tastes and be disappointed in the real thing. Here's another example: Maybe when you watch porn you really like the reverse cowgirl position (girl on top facing away from the guy). As a third party observer this position gives you something to look at. But when you're actually the guy all you see is the girl's back and, again, the sensations of her riding you aren't the same as the just-right wanking feelings you gave yourself when you were watching two other people doing it.

&nbsp;

**Some more observations about how real sex differs from porn and the movies**

&nbsp;

* Obviously in real life it's a lot more sweaty, clumsy, grunty, and primal than dramatic Hollywood love scenes make it out to be.
* In porn the positions are all about making the sex visable to the camera and to give you a good look at the woman's body. In real life concerns such as being close to each other often take precedence.
* Personally I've never had sex under the sheets. They just get in the way.
* Personally I think having sex with all your clothes on kind of sucks (it's a bit awkward and skin on skin contact feels so much better), but you see it all the time in movies and t.v. shows (e.g., The Sopranos). Of course they've got other, more practical, reasons for portraying it like this.
* What amuses me in movies now is what you could call the 'instant penetration.' You see it all the time if you look for it. A man and woman will be in their underwear, or even fully clothed, in some sexually charged situation. Maybe the woman is sitting on the man's lap (both in their underwear remember), or the man is standing behind the woman. The camera is focused on their faces. Then the guy will make a little movement, the woman will gasp, and then they'll close their eyes and start moaning, the implication being that the man achieved vaginal penetration off-camera. Yeah, not that quick and easy in real life. You've got to move your clothes out of the way, line things up, the guy has to be hard enough, the woman needs to be pretty wet, and often the man has to guide his penis in with his hand. Otherwise it's a much more awkward procedure.

1326,Why do Indians have a superiority complex?,65,dj5l29,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dj5l29/why_do_indians_have_a_superiority_complex/,102,"Seriously. Most of our country is corrupt, poor and stupid. No amount of superiority complex is going to fix that. 


""Indians are smarter than white people"". What the fuckitty fuck? More than a quarter of the people are illiterate. No amount of juggad is going to change that. Just because 0.1 percent of your population has an engineering degree, doesn't mean shit for the average illiterate fuck. Living in squalor and saying that Indians are adaptable is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Playing fucking dodge the rickshaw while walking down the road isn't a testament to our intelligence, it's a sign of how stupid our average Bharatvasi is 


""Indians are more cultured"". FFS, India has more cultures of fucking diseases than culture. Playing music on the street and dancing every other week doesn't make you cultured. Neither do rituals. 

""Indians have a richer history"". So did Egypt. Wouldn't exactly call them prosperous now, would you?

"" India has a larger economy than China. The Indian economy take place through cash in rural areas"". So, most of Indian economy is people trading fucking wheat and selling cow shit?

""India can defeat China or the US in a war. The Indian Military budget isn't accounted for inflation"". You're buying military gear from France and Russia, not fucking potatoes from the market. That'd make sense if India had it's own military industrial complex. 

""Indian food is better than Western food"". Where do I even begin? You can have flavor without drinking spicy water. Just cause you dumped spices in water and boiled it doesn't mean your food is better. I like Indian food. I also like Chinese, and European food. I don't like people shitting on non Indian food.

2. In Rafale Deal, they have problems with Reliance getting the contract instead of HAL. But my friends, hasn't privatization been our strategy since economic reforms of 1991? If not Reliance, then whom do they suggest should get this contract?
3. Mob Lynchings and Intolerance: They keep citing a couple of lynchings in the states of UP and Rajasthan and use it as a logical basis to conclude that hatred and intolerance is increasing in India.

I am 54 year old father, living in Mumbai, and earning more than 7 figures a year. Stable job, nice cars and sea facing apartment. Wife is super sweet, all into community work and stuff. Only daughter, who just turned 17.

This post is regarding my daughter. I have just discovered that she is a super flirt (boy, even overtaking me and her mom). As I am typing this, she is right now flirting (some serious shit) with 5 guys, at the same time on Whatsapp, Skype, Line and some other messenger I suppose.

Now, how I found out?

We have installed a hidden CCTV camera in her room (since she was 5 years) and lately, I have found myself listening to the conversations sometimes. The passion and truth with which she enchants, entices these innocent boys is amazing. 

Now, let me tell you.. she has a CC with Rs 5 lakh limit, and we are going to buy her a Micra car next year, when she turns 18. Yes, the guys she is flirting with are rich brats, and money is not the issue here. It seems she loves to flirt, and then dispose them like tissue papers.

I am worried that she may land up in trouble, in case a psycho type of guy falls in 'real' love with her. She is good in studies, and we were planning to send her to Oxford or something, but now, I am real worried.

So, parents of r/India.. how will you handle this situation? Should I talk to her? Talk to the boys? (one of them recently gifted her a painting he painted, and it was superb. She just burnt it yesterday! I mean, is this a disease or something?)

Edit 1: I know the feeling when a girl rejects you, especially when you are 18 years. Its harder than the slap. Hence, I am worried that her flirting nature may land her in trouble. Sooner or later.

Home Minister Dr. G Parameshwarappa has given much importance to the fact that death of the innocent local is outweighed by the shame caused due to false reports on the foreign student.

**This is what happened on that day** -

Mohammad ahmed Ismal, a sudanese, was driving a fiat car under the influence of alchohol. He rammed his vehicle into K. Sanavulla and his wife Shabana Taj causing shabana Taj to die on the spot. The locals chased the car which was fleeing the scene. His car was stopped and when he tried to run, he was beaten by few people. When this was happening, a Wagon-R with three of his friends entered and fought the people, took ahmed with him and fled. Anguished by this, they torched ahmed's car. Not only this, they stopped the Wagon-R at Saptagiri Hospital on Hesaraghatta Road. At this time, the following were in the car - Lina Martina, Saloom and Jamal Ibrahim along with Ahmad who was involved in the earlier accident.

**It is true that her clothes were torn**

After they were stopped the 4 tried to fight the locals and this further angered them and beat all of them including the girl. It was seen that there were more than 50 involved with the mob. Lina's clothes were torn in the scuffle. Police who arrived on the scene took ahmed into custody. But, it has to be known that nowhere in all of this was lina sexually assaulted or paraded nakedly. A local resident, prameela, has further said, if at all there was a naked parade they would've done it to ahmed who ran people over, but there was no reason to parade Lina.

**Some observations** - 

* sudden visit by the DGP for this accident but not for any of the local rapes such as the ones in madawala, cubbon park, or the school child's rape. Doesn't local sexual assaults not worthy of this much attention?
* No one is bothered about the dead victim who had nothing to do with this. She hasn't even received any condolences from any official involved. (think what would've happened if BJP was in power here)

**Answers needed by the home ministry for the following** -

* Does the ministry doesn't know about the other illegal  activities of African students?
* Isn't the local news report not according to your requirement?
* Haven't you noticed the attack by these students on the police

With the culprit standing right in front of you and in fact beating you, I'm sure anywhere in the world would there be a mob formed. No need to bring in the circus of racial or sexual assault into this. This is just case of Mob violence and has to be treated the same.",Non-Political

I would still vote for modi & BJP.  Despite of being disappointed with him and his team on multiple occasions, I believe BJP is still better of the devils. 

I'm impressed with his vision and the work he's have done so far on nation's infrastructure ( especially roads and railways ). 

I'm also impressed by his efforts towards changing our traditional Indian way of living (e.g. spreading awareness about cleanliness , promoting accountability and transparency in govt departments, Psu etc).

When I voted for him in 2014 I knew that issues he is targeting won't go away magically in few years. Practices like corruption, spreading filth and pollution, zero sense of personal and professional accountability are deep rooted in our society. No modi, gandhi or anyone else can fix these issues in a term.

On rape , I see it is an unfortunate endemic majorly due to our traditionally patriarchal yet repressed society. I understand  that with more females getting aware of their rights and with support of law such incidents will surely go down in numbers. This is why , though  I am deeply embarrassed and disappointed by how Kathua and UP incidents were handled by BJP, I refuse to see them as a report card of Modi government.


To sum it , I'd give another term to Modi. Despite of many flaws , he has the better vision  for our country going forward.

P.S : I have had many discussions with pro and anti-modi friends on the matter. For most of the issues I believe that Congress wouldn't be able to handle them any better.

Yes, westerners do come to India, but not because its a beautiful place, as they claim.

I was in the middle of Atheist enlightenment phase of my life and I scoffed at her. Owaisi was just one more religious rabble rouser, I said. She reiterated: It makes sense within the religious context, because both sides aim to use a religion argument. I agreed to that while still chuckling at what I saw as a non-meritorious argument.


When the Babri Masjid verdict came out on Saturday, my first reaction was to google what Muslim leaders thought of the verdict. It had never bothered me before that there was none I found remotely interesting or even appealing, but it did now. I sadly googled the relevant keywords followed by Owaisi and refresh the page a few times hoping something would come up.

It was as if I was in the Chappelle skit, mockingly calling for Ja Rule to make sense of the disaster that was hurricane Katrina(?) - except that it was in total earnestness. Such is the state of my community that we have so few representatives - some of which have happily sold themselves to the saffron. 

I've since accepted that for even if only for the current period of time, he is the one Muslim politician that I look at as a leader. 


I imagine so many hindus must gravitate towards Modi with a similar distaste of the available hindu leaders, but if in a country with a billion people of your community, a community that has representation across financial and political spectrum and the best man you find to look upto as a leader is a fella previously accused of genocide - let off only because he destroyed the evidence, I'd say that your reasons for looking upto him are suspect. 


So here I am. A decidedly non practicing Muslim that now follows Owaisi's political career with quite some interest. I might even vote for him given the chance. Either way, i'm rooting for him. 

I understand that this post will attract a lot of negative attention, so I've marked it [R]. I'm not here to fight, but if thats how you see things, So be it.",Politics

Background:

Cow was never worshiped in our home.

 Have been feeding cow and calf in my home, Every Morning and every After Noon for 19+ years and still doing whenever getting chance to do.

We always have had an extended joint family and we never purchased milk  from outside.
I cannot digest milk from Amul or Tirumala or Dairy Mother or whatever because I throw up.

We have and always had and will always have  land next to our hut(Yes, Not a pakka,real, house) in which the shelter we give to cow are as good as the ones we have(can afford) ourself.

Be it rainy season and it is 2 AM in the night, one of my family, and  many a times me, used to go and double check if the cow and calf are not getting drenched.(Sometimes the roofs would just start leaking :())

Before having tea in the morning one of our family  feeds the cow and calf and if moderate sunlight is expected put the cow and the calf outside shelter.

If we discovered too much sunlight then someone had to rush from the farm to make sure the calf and cow are not getting heated.

Maintaining a cow is  expensive , we made sure that we commit the double the amount of food for the calf and cow  which we might need during each month.

Also, whenever the cow got any sickness  it was as much,if not more pressure (economic,emotional) and stress on elderly members (extended family) to what it would have been had one of the younger child got any sickness.


Also, in some cases you can ignore the sickness of some adult so that it can take care of itself but not in case of cows and calf.


Somehow you have to be always prepared to get injections and animal  doctor help if the calf and cow make out of pattern sound any day.

The love of calf and cow is quite cute, just before milking the cow we would release the calf for a few minutes to be with the cow.


While milking the cow we would always make sure the cow is licking the calf with love.


Also, if the calf is new born we would not milk the cow for one month and let the calf have all the milk,both in morning and evening.

Many a days if and only if the weather would be moderate, we would leave the cow in the open field to roam and graze(on land over which anyone's cow can graze) and in the evening(read sunset) the cow (not always) would and do come back to their designated place, and we would feed them.

Water temperature is always double checked whenever we give the cow and the calf water to drink and to mix in the food we give them.

And, Yes, I have regularly used cow dung   paste(with my bare hands ) to make goitha and used it in winter to regulate the cold in home and the cow shelter land.

Also, we have to have quite a few blankets to cover the cow shelter in winter seasons.And, you cannot just put fire in the place and smoke the cow and calf (cannot afford the AC for neither ourself nor the cow).


My mother and other elderly members see the news these days, and I have to see and hear the sadness everyday.

**It is like hearing the story of death of one of your own would be babies.**

**Has the world become that barbaric ?   


 **What If I tweet, I just ate a baby whose daddy used to eat cow flesh ?**
It is impossible for me to even type the word over which the people are debating the ban.

**It is not possible for me to imagine,let alone type the word,forget imagining humans chewing it(Yes, I know it has some vitamin which is not found otherwise in other foods), of the B.ban.**

**Please, Stop talking about it.**


I know I cannot stop people from doing(read eating)  other things and I am fully aware of the math  that same surface area land if used for grazing by cows will give different  return on investment if  the cow is  not used for milking consumption but other uses.

Yes,I also Know that My country exports largest amount.

Please,Stop Talking about and stop using the B word.


Imagine  cats,birds,puppies being chewed in your neighborhood and you have been having  them as loving pets forever.
And,Do not give me the analogy of colored fish.


I refrain to disclose my caste, but my counting numbers My caste is a minority.

Before you attack myself Note :

~~I work for one of the top 10 richest software companies (NOT SERVICE BASED ), and I am from nobody's tier 5  college and I have long time  American Girlfriend (~~Pure White~~ (  I mean it).~~

  
Edit:
  
1) I mentioned about Job, so that people may not assume that I not living in denial in some village at the moment.

1.1) I mentioned non service based, because monthly I see a post bashing the services companies? 

1.1.1) I mentioned about the richness of the company, not about my own salary.  


2) I mentioned about color of skin about GF because it is common to assume that Americans eat the item, but It was not a deterring  factor in discriminating from either side   and she does not blabber like people are doing these days(on twitter, the hindu).

My points are :

1. Make a law so that Cannibals  don't get discriminated against in office and residential area .

2. Buying and selling of human meat should be made legal . The licenses should be issued in a strict manner with all the background checks put in place so that no mischief is done .

3. Only Adult person's meat should be available . Any other meat should be considered illegal .

4. Age of consent should be decided , my recommendation is 16 years or more .

5. Prior permission from magistrate court should be taken before slaughtering a human . 

6. Consent of the person to be slaughtered and the person buying should be done in person before the magistrate .

7. The person buying can't move back on his claim over the dead body .

8. Money , place and time of slaughter should be mentioned before hand .

9. The money shall be given to the nominee of the person to be slaughtered . Nominee should be a relative of the person .

10. A policeman should be present at the time of slaughter so that no inhuman ways are adopted .

Edit : One should also mention the type of meat one needs on the contract .

It provides them with zero balance accounts, a debit card, accidental and life insurance, and enables direct benefits transfer to their bank account.

[Per this article from Firstpost](http://www.firstpost.com/business/jan-dhan-scores-drop-zero-balance-accounts-lpg-subsidies-flow-2076995.html) (with data sourced from the scheme's website):

>According to the latest figures available from the PMJDY website, some **125.5 million bank accounts have been opened** as on 31 January. Of these, **84.5 million are zero balance accounts**.

>On 31 January, the **zero-balance accounts were down to 67 percent of the total, down four percent from the 71 percent which had no cash in them just 10 days before** that. 

>It is estimated that **nearly eight million fresh accounts have become operative with some cash balances in them during this 10-day period.**

>**Of the 15-and-odd crore LPG users, nearly 9.75 crore have signed up for direct benefits transfer**, which is a healthy 66 percent of the total.

>At last count, **Jan Dhan accounts had Rs 10,500 crore of balances, which too is growing robustly. Ten days ago, the balance was Rs 9,218 crore – a rise of 14 percent.**

>According to a review of the DBT scheme on 31 January by the Prime Minister, data from 54 districts where the scheme was rolled out initially show that **“growth of subsidised LPG has reduced significantly, accompanied by a corresponding increase in the sale of commercial LPG.** This indicates that the scheme will enable substantive savings in subsidy which can then be deployed for other productive purposes, without reducing any entitlements of existing consumers.”

Now let us look at [former IRS officer Kejriwal's take on the scheme](http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/arvind-kejriwal-ridicules-modis-jan-dhan-yojna-says-no-money-in-peoples-account/):

>AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal today ridiculed ‘Jan Dhan Yojna’ **claiming lakhs of accounts opened under Prime Minister Narendra Modi‘s pet scheme have ‘no money’ and people will get insurance benefits under it only after death**.

>“I heard the Prime Minister talking about opening bank accounts of lakhs of people (under Jan Dhan Yojna (JDY)) **but then where is the money?** He now said that they will give insurance of Rs one lakh, which a person will get after he dies,” he said while addressing a rally.

Of all the schemes, actions, and statements of the government, he chooses to ridicule the one scheme that could free the most marginalised sections of society from the clutches of moneylenders, ensure government welfare reaches them instead of being siphoned off, and provides them with accident and life insurance.

Why the fuck is every character a Bannerjee or a Chatterjee? In an entire fucking movie, did Shoojit Sircar never think how pretty fucked up this whole premise sounds?

2. Why the fuck is the only Dalit cleaning toilets? Do they only exist to do that?

3. Why the hell does Irrfan Khan refuse to sit next to the cleaner? And how the fuck is he the ""good"" guy therefore? What the fuck was that? So fucking shocking. How on earth did the director think this was okay?

4. Why is everyone so hell bent on last names? Like honestly. Why? 

Argh. I could cite many more subtle instances but I'll stop now. It's a terrible nonsensical movie with so much blatant casteism, it's jarring. I'm surprised no one protested. But I guess showing Dalits their place is the hip thing to do. And this bullshit is one of the better movies of the year? 

In the US, Aziz Ansari created Master of None to point out these discrepancies, only then, race was the major talking point. The parallels in India are eerily shocking. To the people who say casteism is dead, no. It's alive and thriving and being praised in mainstream pop culture. Open your fucking eyes. And this is supposed to be progressive cinema? The fuck!

Shame on us really.

My source is the [India human development report, by the Planning Comission, 2011] (www.pratirodh.com/pdf/human_development_report2011.pdf). 

Focusing on the development claims of Gujarat versus the rest of India, here are its findings:

1. Gujarat ranks 11th in overall Human Development Index (HDI), behind Kerala, Delhi, Himachal, Goa, Punjab, North East, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, and J&K.

2. It ranks 17th in terms of the change in HDI in 2000--2008; it is below the national average.

3. It ranks 15th in terms of the change in the Income Index (consumption expenditure); it is below the national average.

4. It ranks 21th in terms of the change in the Education Index; it is below the national average.

5. It ranks 12th in terms of the change in Health Index; it is below the national average.

Even in terms of other indicators like poverty, child nutrition, women's health, infant mortality, life expectancy, sex ratio, availability of toilets, drinking water, literacy rate, pucca house, mobile phones, road length, etc. it fares in the middle of the pack.

In particular, I've reversed my hair loss, and cured my anxiety.  

I was inspired by this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3v54ir/indian_nutritional_problems_analyzed/

Much of that post is true, some of it is false.  

In particular, saturated fat does not cause cardiovascular disease.  This is something you see repeated very often on the western internet.  

The cause of cholesterol plaques is subclinical hypothyroidism; thyroid hormones metabolize cholesterol into steroid hormones.  The cause of the hypothyroidism is [the ubiquity of polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) in the modern diet](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3gm4nnaudnE/TlGK3y1X0uI/AAAAAAAAA0U/YPMc-DJeMKQ/s1600/LA+in+human+fat+2011.jpg), which directly inhibit oxidative metabolism, and encourage inefficient glycolysis.  

Several years ago, I began taking omega 3 pills, and a few months afterward I started getting hair loss, as well as liver spots forming on my hairline.  I also became very light sensitive, and needed sunglasses everywhere.  I chanced upon the following article:  

http://raypeat.com/articles/articles/fishoil.shtml

It addressed both the liver spots (lipofuscin) and the light sensitization problems I'd been having, so I decided that the author knew something about omega 3s that most others did not.  

I started reading the rest of Peat's work, and would occasionally give one of his guidelines a try, and I would only see drastic improvement every time I did.  **I highly recommend reading and understanding the articles, and experimenting to see what changes work best for you.**  

**Problems with the Indian diet:**  

- High in PUFA oils (antimetabolic)
- High in legumes and other fermentable fibrous vegetables (promote bacterial growth, which produces endotoxin, which elevates estrogen)
- Vegetarian (missing key nutrients like zinc, selenium, B vitamins, adequate protein, gelatin)

**Things that have personally helped a lot:**

- Ceasing consumption of all fermentable fibers.  Basically, I don't eat anything that gives me any amount of gas.  The only vegetables I eat are bamboo shoots and raw carrots.  I eat mushrooms as well.  
- Vitamin K2.  This vitamin is needed for proper calcium deposition.  When I took it, my jaw got wider, my hair grew back, my facial hair got softer, and my anxiety disappeared.  Highly recommend.  
- Taking a big shit every day.  Your fecal matter contains toxins excreted through the bile, as well as toxins produced by enteric bacteria.  The faster you can get feces out of your large intestine, the better.  
- Coffee helps a lot with taking big shits very regularly, and is healthful otherwise.  
- Raw carrots are very good at relieving anxiety, because they are antibacterial, and thus indirectly anti-estrogenic.  Also a good source of fiber which cannot be fermented (because it is antibacterial)
- Gelatinous soups/broths, made from pig feet, chicken feet, lamb bones, etc.  
- Avoiding all PUFA.  This means avoiding ALL oils except for coconut oil, palm oil, and olive oil.  Almost 100% of restaurant food and street food is cooked in PUFA oil, so functionally this means a lot of eating at home.  This also means avoiding foods that contain these oils as major constituents (most nuts, avocados, etc.: check if you're unsure)

**What I might eat and do in a day:**

- Coffee in the morning, with sugar and cream
- Defecate
- Eggs and orange juice for breakfast (protein should be eaten with sugar)
- Rasmalai (ricotta cheese/milk/saffron/cardamom with plenty of sugar)
- 1 mg Vitamin K2, 1000 IU Vitamin D, depending on when I last took these, and how I feel at the moment.  I don't supplement daily, and I depend on butter for Vitamin A.  
- Ripe bananas
- Steak cooked in butter, with rosemary/thyme/white wine",Food

1440,I am fed up of India.,5,4ahuk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4ahuk9/i_am_fed_up_of_india/,25,"Hello there. I hope that the moderators here do not remove this topic, thread, I don't really know what it is called. I hardly post here and I usually just lurk on this subreddit. I am really bad at typing these paragraphs but I will give it a go. 

For the past few months, I have been thinking about this a lot. India has been a very terrible experience for me. I live in Chandigarh which is considered to be one of the most developed cities in our country which is a joke, this city is terrible when compared to the cities in the western countries. The rest of India is way worse, when a person who lives in one of the most ""developed"" cities of a country says that the city is very bad due to the infrastructure available then that's a real shame for the government. There's not a single thing I like about this country (except for the food, I love it) at all, I read the news daily in hopes of reading something which shows that our country is finally developing but no, all I see is news that depresses the hell out of me. The worst thing is that this news doesn't even show the full picture, many things still happen and we don't even know about them at all. Fine, every country has their secrets, so does India. No matter where I go, all I see is filth and terrible infrastructure. I cringe whenever my relatives and friends say ""Hey, look, a new house is being constructed! Development!"" I am not sure if this happens with everybody else. I am not an expert at this but if a house is being built in a place with the worst infrastructure possible, that doesn't mean development. Instead, you're making the situation worse because it would have to be destroyed for constructing something (in case that happens which is impossible). India's government is one of the most inefficient governments I have ever seen, getting work done here is a blessing. I see people posting on this subreddit thinking their opinions actually matter (I know whatever I am saying is an opinion too but I wanted to let it all out), people sending e-mails to TRAI, etc. thinking there will be a change. Even if there's a change, will it make our country any better to be honest? Most redditors here think that they're different from the rest of the country, let me tell you, it's the contrary. All I see is stupid arguments about governments, Modi, Arvind Kejrival, etc. which doesn't help us in anyway. You are literally spending an hour arguing with a person you will never meet in real life. Even if you do win the argument, will it really make any difference? 

My blood boils whenever I see a poor person on the streets because I am unable to help him/her, there are millions of these people. Hell, even we are poor when compared to the people in the western countries. I look at China and see how much they have developed and look at where India is, it's a huge shame for the government. I always notice false hope in the news, people keep living in India thinking that the country will change in a good way, no, it won't. At least not in a couple of decades (I am being extremely optimist here), there would have to be a huge change in the way how the government works to actually achieve any important infrastructural development. I don't really understand why people say that India is diverse and then say it is a good thing. Yes, people from different religions living in a country is a nice thing but do you see what's happening in India? Bloodshed, I would rather live a country with just one religion than a country with 5-6 religions, it only leads to conflicts.
The education system in India is an absolute joke, all I see is students cheating recklessly to score marks and even if they do, they don't succeed in their lives. It's all about the theory, many of my relatives didn't know how to do a job because they just used to cram books. The worst thing I have seen is that whenever we refer to India (before 1947), we forget about Pakistan and Bangladesh. They were also a part of the independence struggle but nowadays, I even see the educated folks insulting them. Just because they're now in a different country? I still consider them Indian, I go to various sites and I see people mocking Pakistan. Many of my relatives are still in Pakistan and I am from Pakistan myself (I am a Sikh). It just feels really bad when I see everybody insulting the people of our own country, the ones of the same origin as us. 

This may sound a  bit far-fetched but Pakistan and India are the same for me, not because of the culture or anything but because of the violence. It doesn't matter how people die, whether they die in terrorist attacks or andolans (protests), people are still dying. My great-grandmother used to say that India will once be as developed as the western countries. Well, I will have to say that she would have been extremely disappointed if she was still alive. I often travel to cities like Amritsar, Jalandhar, etc. and I see that many of the buildings are there since the time of independence, they're still in the same condition. India is changing, you are correct about that but in a bad way (infrastructure-wise at the very least). Okay, let's say that I should forget about the infrastructure, we still need to improve a lot when it comes to our own homes. The internet speed is terrible, the power-cuts and brownouts are terrible, the water is terrible, there's nothing good to point out. If India really wants to change then we will have to destroy a lot of buildings, etc. and start from scratch, all of these houses which are being built feel temporary to me because they don't constitute development at all. The road in front of my house is a 2-lane road, whenever people come to our house, they are shocked to see such a wide road. This thing alone makes me very sad because people in the western countries are used to having a 4-lane road (or more) in front of their houses.
This world isn't fair at all, what did I do to deserve to be born in such a country? I know I am offending everybody but this is the truth. We are all helpless, there's nothing we can do. People keep chanting ""Swacch Bharat!"" but it doesn't mean anything because picking up a few packets of Kurkure, Lays chips, etc. which are lying on a really poorly built road won't help much.

As far as I can tell, India will stay the same, even if it does change, it will take a lot of time and I'd rather not spend that time in this country. I am going abroad as quickly as I can but I don't think I can because my parents don't want to leave India. I am sorry if I offended any of you guys with this but I always see people complaining about something here, thinking that there can be a change. Sadly, there won't be a change. India is totally fucked. It's going to implode any time, in fact, it already is (thanks to all of these stupid riots, protests, etc.). India's too far gone. 

If I were you, I would have left the country long ago. I want to love my country and respect it but I can't respect a country where 99.99% of the population is still living in shitty conditions. 

I hope the best for India.

>Not only do those interviewed spell out details of the planning, they also allegedly reveal how enthusiastic young participants were deliberately used as cannon fodder by provoking a police firing on kar sevaks in 1990 because of the belief of some leaders that the movement would not gather steam unless 'some Hindus die'.

-

>""In front of me, Singhal told Maharaj (Vamdev), the movement won't gain momentum unless some people die. Maharaj Vamdev said it'd be disastrous if children die. Singhal again said the movement won't get a fillip until they die."" Sakshi claims well-known karsevaks like the Kothari brothers from Bengal and Mahendra Singh of Rajastan were targeted by police at the behest of vested interests spearheading the Ram Janmabhoomi movement.

Given BJP's reaction, it looks like they treat it as a matter of fact as if killing of humans is like killing off pawns in a chess game.

1. As the sidebar will soon show (or shows now, depending on how slowly I type this), personal attacks against (abuse towards, personal information of, furry pictures of(!)) another user will NOT be allowed. If you feel another user is abusing you, report them. At that point, removal of the post is as per moderator discretion. So don't report people just for disagreeing with you. That's called being petty.

2. You get three chances. If three of your comments/posts are removed for personal attacks, you're outta here. You will be banned from posting/commenting on /r/India. You will be shunned by us. tHeSiD will steal your puppy. On these grounds, we are decided.

3. ~~ All comment karma for the offenders will be taken and converted to link karma for the mods.~~ *I'm being told that we can't do that.*

Here ends my meandering monologue.

TL;DR No personal attacks. Report them. Three removals = ban. 

Some clarifications.

1. Mods will NOT touch posts until they are reported.

2. Once reported, posts will be read in context and judged on a case-by-case basis. Report =/= removal. Report + Mod agreement = removal.

3. We are not out to wash your mouths out with soap. We are here to stop the recent jump in copycat accounts that do nothing but abuse specific users. 

4. We are NOT the morality police.  We are just here to stop people who have nothing better to do than insult others, without ever adding commenting on anything else.

5. We aren't even considering removing trolls or off-colour jokes/comments. That is left up to you guys to vote on as you see fit.",

It's wrong to equate British India, which includes many areas that ought to be classified as Middle Eastern and East Asian, with the cultural concept of India, which includes much of Nepal, Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka and Maldives.

1461,"[R] Why are so many Indians, especially those living in Western nations - so caught up with their Indian identity and pride for the same ?",0,4dyes5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4dyes5/r_why_are_so_many_indians_especially_those_living/,35,"I am a firm believer in the view that ethnic and religious nationalism is the starting point in many a conflict in the world. I have seen what happens in the muslim world, in the middle ages with christianity and now I am seeing it happen in India.

Identity based pride and ethno-religious nationalism are the bane of modern society.

What is even more baffling to me is people who left India for greener pastures who still cling on to their sense of identity. Leaving aside the handful of those who are selfish dollar-chasing individuals going their only for the money, surely the secular humanist values of the West and the state of their society itself is an attraction ? Or am I mistaken ?

So my question is thus : In India many components of what makes up society, culture, religion, politics and the very system have just rotted away. When the roots themselves are in this sorry state, why try to cling on to them so desperately ?

Should you not want to move away from the homeland and try to adjust with the society that you now live in ?

Lot of NRI fans of Modi and BJP I find very surprising. BJP is a right leaning party, and that means you are proud of your heritage and want to keep the social order intact. Given that there are so many problems in India how on earth can people who moved out of the country hold on to such views ?

To give a few examples to clarify what i mean - so many problems in India : corruption, bad politicians, dirty filthy public places, spitting on the road, rape, casteism, caste murder, hatred towards women. So many problems with religion also - muslims in India are v.v.backward, hindus are also backward in different ways. Same can be said of other religions too. Maybe that is at the root of why India is in such a mess.
So if you are a conservative, must you not be either :

a) in a state of denial about the problems of India or

b) proud of India good along with bad

Conservatives want to keep the same social order and not change it - so that means they are happy with what currently is in place in India.


I have less sympathy for Indian conservatives because unlike American conservatives they have much less to be proud of. Americans have built one of the greatest nations on earth, and have contributed much to humanity in the realm of sciences and technology. India has contributed some stuffs in the ancient era, but now ? it is just quagmire of casteism, corruption, inequality, poverty and misogyny. How can you be proud of that ?


If you want to hold on to your roots with such vigor how do you resolve this dillemma ? How can you condone the numerous issues in your homeland, and then say that you are proud ? I do not understand.

On this big Indian subreddit (/r/india) I can see people routinely criticizing their homeland, and pride is often talked down. But here the NRI population seems all too happy to be proud about India, why is that ?

If you are not aware there are other subreddits that have India pride sentiments but they are mostly rejects and extremists. On twitter there is now an all out war between those who are proud of india and those who distance themselves from all this and are open to discussing the problems India faces. There is a subreddit for NRIs called ABCDesi but they too are averse to even discussing this topic.

TLDR: Identity politics is what leads to vote banks, and taken to extreme fascistic nationalism. Why do so many Indians both in India and without still hold on to this way of thinking ?

TLDR2: Why do Indians living outside India love the BJP brand of politics, and Modi, to this level ?",[R]eddiquette

1475,[RANT POST] I feel sorry for us Indians today,0,2y6f1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2y6f1l/rant_post_i_feel_sorry_for_us_indians_today/,8,"I feel deeply sorry for Indians at large for two reasons.

1. Of course the views shown in documentary which reflect the thought process of a major section of the society, not limited to any religion. It really is an ""Indian"" problem. Not Hindu, Not Muslim, Not Christian, Not any other religion but it is specifically a fallacy of Indian mind and a perverted definition of ""Indian Culture"" in the mind of the people.

2. The whole new generation of the youngsters on the social media, the impatient Gen Y of the country who think that they have a progressive world view but lack the most basic quality of progressive thinking, the thirst of fact finding. The generation is too quick to build opinions without doing some fact check at all.

What I want to discuss here is the point two.

Where are we headed? In what direction are we taking the next generation?

All the hoopla around the documentary ban was marketed by irresponsible media houses as government's feeble attempt to save its face.

Was the documentary worth broadcast and put in public domain? Yes, definitely yes.

Was the ban on the documentary imposed for the reason as propagated by media houses and widely spread on social media by our progressive next generation? No, definitely no.

The documentary ban was not because of the content. No matter which politician said what on what television channel about it is secondary, but what was the official stance of the government behind the broadcast ban? What did my country's Home Minister have to say about it? What did the ""democratically elected government""have to say about the reason for the ban?

The official stance of the government can be read here: http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=116442

Now I want to simply state that on one hand, we cry out loud about creating stricter laws and better enforcement to fight the evil of rape prevalent in our society but do we have the decency to respect our existing laws? Did we respect the term and conditions which were laid down by the OUR Home Ministry and OUR Jail Administration to a FOREIGN NATIONAL? Did we respect the sanctity of the rules created by our constitution? The answer in its entirety is a big NO.

We abused and mocked our government for banning the documentary without trying to know the reason behind it. We shielded a foreign national who worked around the rules and regulations created under the limitations of the constitution of India to protect the sovereignty of our nation. We valued words of a person with god knows what agenda above the words of our government.

I really feel sorry to say that I am an Indian today, not because of what documentary had shown -- most of us already knew about how society thinks as most of us know at least 20 people who carry the same stance as the people who are being shown in the documentary in our social circles. I am sorry because how gullible we are and how we made a nobody overnight famous and made ourselves cash cow of the same imperialists, who robbed and looted and sucked the life out of country for 200 years.

Please grow up. Stop seeing everything as black & white. Use your rationale and don't believe everything the media tells you. We have glorified a stooge who had no value for our sovereignty. We glorified a channel which had no value for our laws and our constitution. We have mocked our own government which was trying to uphold the sovereignty and sanctity of our laws and constitution.

1476,"No, all Indians don't condone rape and india is not a sick society. India should protect her both culture and image while making progressive changes towards the 21st century.",0,2y6eeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2y6eeg/no_all_indians_dont_condone_rape_and_india_is_not/,0,"It needs to be said that there are some historical factors that contributed to the situation in Delhi and other places in India where rapes have occurred. No doubt that rape is very disgusting, unfair and sickening but we can't forget that India is still trying to recover culturally from invasions by Islam and England that lasted over centuries with traumatic damage to its inherent reasoning, economy and physical landscape. It is a post-colonial society.

The Muslims were especially terrible on the North side of India (where the brutal rape occurred) and they had a habit of enslaving and treating people with general disrespect so Indians adapted a more defensive tone against their women for protection, thus birthing the oppressive instinct lingering ever since on the north side. Indian women have become more liberal recently however (More power to them!) and the brutal rape was a terrible reaction by the four idiots in Delhi to their perceptions of freedom which was considered taboo or insulting in the north side. I'm truly happy that two of the rapists have been put to death and the last two will be soon. Indian women have been known to enjoy more openness in society towards the South of India because the Muslims did not invade that far and denigrate the culture.

India was also made extremely poor by the British and they wreaked havoc on the social fabric of the entire subcontinent by creating motivations for the caste system and turning the different clans against one another while justifying it as a rigid vertical hierarchy (which it originally was not) with bigger rewards for those at the top. Plus England was responsible for the British East India Tea company and as a whole, they looted the entire continent of its resources and then used that money to further colonize the rest of the world to our chagrin today... India was not called Britain's crown jewel for no reason! And yes, the British East Tea company was supposedly run by a psychopath. 

My final point is that India is still trying to recover (as it has many times before) from the negative aspects of its colonial history and its lingering side effects but Indians are still making progress in their own right. If Indians and everyone else would actually look further back throughout its history; then they would see India's amazing proto-cultural, intellectual and proto-spiritual developments that have existed even before the first monotheistic faith (Zoroastianism) stepped foot on the Earth. In other words, India is still the enduring legacy of an ancient civilization crucial to world development; and no, it did not get there by disrespecting it's women- it was however an arbiter of trade in the silk roads, invented the number 0 in mathematics and calculated the age of our planet as billions of years old (similar to modern scientific thought) when no one else even considered such things. It is also the place and culture where yoga and meditation came into existence that we enjoy today in the west so please don't judge India or Indians based on any British perspective about rape because England has already enslaved and pillaged the majority of the world's cultural identity and resources (which is also a form of rape if you truly think about it...)

Please don't misunderstand though, rape is not OK and there is a need for a continuing line of Indian progress/recovery within its own country but Britain does not deserve the right to evoke an isolated emotional reaction in absence of the objective world history that it has negatively contributed to in terms of culture; so please research everything, don't fall for emotional propaganda and always keep questioning!

Let the truth prevail...

1490,The problem with current CAA protests - from a right wingers perspective,12,f96yyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/f96yyo/the_problem_with_current_caa_protests_from_a/,133,"Note: The post is based on the fundamental premise that India needs to meet these objectives,

a. Secure borders and eliminate any illegal immigration 

b. Deport any illegal immigrants 

If you do not agree to these points, viz. you strongly believe in open borders, we cant have any meaningful discussion - and just agree to disagree. 

Post: The current problems with the CAA protests as I perceive them,

1. Blanket refusal stating 'kagaz nahi dikhayenge' - this is not a great stratgey. Rather, there should be solid proposals from them on how to meet the objectives stated above. If NPR and CAA are unacceptable, what should be alternate methods to achieve these objectives? 

2. Citizenship extension to all illegal immigrants except muslims - this obviously is the crux of the matter, because this aspect clearly discriminates between ilegal immigrants based on their religion. The question then becomes, are anti CAA protestors, protesting on the behalf of Hazaras, Ahmadis and Rohingyas? If so, India already has a system in place to naturalize persecuted minorities so I dont understand why this is such a contentious issue. 

As I see it, albeit with all my biases, the protests  are a boiling over of the suppressed anger against 370, Babri, triple talaq and the soon to be uniform civil code. Also center/left leadership are inciting fear of minority deportation, for political gains. 

Tl;dr - rather than seemingly directionless and rigid protests, anti CAA movement should come up with alternate(s) on a better way to achieve anti--illegal immigration objectives.

*** 

Seeing that the thread has crossed a 100 comments, now is as good a time as any to summarize things and give a final perspective from my pov,

1. While there was a great deal of participation and discussion, it mostly centered around why the CAA+NRC must be repealed as a whole, without any real, better alternative that could meet the objectives 

2. It was clear that there is a great deal of fear and anger over the suspicion that legal muslim citizens will be deported enmasse, but as to what evidence this sentiment is based on was quite unclear 

3. There were also multiple occasions when participants wanted to challenge the premise of stricter immigration laws and whether they are even a truly pressing issue - to this all I want to say on this point is that while there are economic arguments on both sides, this is also an emotive issue for RW folks like me, it is not necessary that it make a strong economic case (which I strongly feel it does). Whether you choose to agree or disagree, it is important that we understand each other on this, personal attacks online or now as we are seeing in the real world, will only dilute and belittle the anti CAA stance. 

If nothing else, this thread helped me better empathize with those of the opposing view, at least their fears and motivations. 

Thanks for your participation.",CAA-NRC

""Why should we invest in better training facilities and spend money on gymnastics, when Dipa Karmakar managed to win a medal at the Olympics with what she has?""

Instead, I am glad she finished fourth. It is the perfect place to show how talented and hard working Indian athletes are, to come so far when at such a huge disadvantage compared to countries like the US, China, and Russia, but it is also the perfect place to hopefully convince the government to invest more in sports other than cricket. 

This can be the wakeup call for India to think ""Wait.. maybe we can actually become a respected and competitive team in ALL sports, not just cricket, if only we provide better opportunities for those who are interested."" 

Maybe if we work towards this for the next four years, then at the next Olympics we can see Dipa take home gold, and maybe even see other athletes take home gold in more events like swimming and track and field. 

Congrats to Dipa and all athletes who represented India at the Olympics. You have achieved so much with so little compared to other countries. Very proud to be an Indian today, and every day!",Sports

1509,Some thoughts on Devyani issue,11,1t8an2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1t8an2/some_thoughts_on_devyani_issue/,116,"
When a diplomat from your nation is subjected to strip search (get naked in front of high school grad police officers) and cavity search (get a probe with a camera inserted into your anus, vagine), the last thing your nation's citizens should be doing is celebrating ""workers rights"". You should be throwing paint at the US Embassy, boycotting American businesses, and generally creating a deterrent for such future behavior by America.


The workers rights issue is much more complex than you leftist idealist morons imagine. America considers its Embassy in India as US territory where US laws apply. Then why aren't the Indians working there getting US minimum wages? 194 nations send their diplomats with personal help to the US. 175 of those nations are probably much poorer than the US, so much so that their diplomats themselves make lower than US minimum wage.

From the help's perspective, this was a golden opportunity to get a free pass to a Green Card via creating a manufactured controversy. Even when an expat (the help is also an expat) goes from a poor nation to a rich nation, the employer often gives free board and lodging, but keeps the salary consistent with the home nation levels. Otherwise, the help would earn something like 100 years worth salary through one year overseas. Nowhere do you see such sweetheart deals.

Did America give restitution to the blacks for centuries of free labor under slavery? Why aren't all of you jumping up and down over the trillions of dollars stolen from blacks?

The reality is that you people are just so frustrated with your own lives that you cannot dispassionately analyze the situation, and exhibit pragmatic idealism. So, you jump to outdo each other in how dramatic and inane you can make your protests. You show no loyalty to your people, your nation, your diplomats. All you self-loathing and self-righteous bumbledikks chanting praises for America while America pokes needles into your butts are incapable of intelligent analysis.

Even murderous US soldiers like Bales (killed dozens of Afghan women and kids) are defended and get the benefit of doubt. That is how a strong team behaves - united, no matter what. You Indians are pathetic self-hating losers. You cannot stand up for your religion, not for your parents, not for your team and not for your nation. You are all loose cannons, spraying aimlessly, until your ammunition runs out.

By the way, I am an American citizen. Shame on you Indians for not standing up with a backbone against America. Even Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq defeated America's intentions. You Indians will run with your tails between your legs if American ever attacks you. No wonder the British were able to rule with a handful of their agents over your lands - you people are the most easy targets for foreign rulers. You love to bend over and take it.

I don't understand why Kabir Singh is being judged by Randians!. 
Firstly, to those prying about the story killing the concept of consent and romance, I guess you have been so brainwashed by Bollywood movies and soap opera where the male protagonist ALWAYS TAKES CONSENT before kissing her and DOESN'T SING a song ABOUT HER PHYSICAL BEAUTY, EMBARRASSING HER IN PUBLIC, that you judge a raw and wild portrayal of a character.
Is Kabir Singh HORNY and OBJECTIFIES WOMEN? He never stalked a women, never commented on a women, no booing, no cat calling even before meeting his first and last love Preeti. No whistling the lady and shouting her name. no getting into fights just to show his masculinity and impress her. Who are you to judge how two people in a relationship behave with each other.

Another radian was very upset that movie had a scene where the hero tries to cut a women's dress with knife. According to this person KABIR SINGH is SADIST< RAPIST. I guess maybe the Redditor failed to realise that women(married) apparently wanted to sleep with the doctor who treated her husband. And NO the hero doesn't drag her into it. Maybe the Redditor doesn't get wild intercourse or foreplay. She brings UP and Bihar and I am really glad she brought up that. I wonder if she has watched Bhojpori movies. People like these are only worthy of the stereotype love stories where the hero is a scum who lives on the street, never been to college, shames the heroine by singing a song on her fairness, dances and forces her to dance or wait as soon as he sings she joins him to dance being impressed, and fights with the goons.

Bottom line I think it's RIDICULOUSLY STUPID AND DUMB to tag all those anti-rape feminist tags to a character who didn't judge her girlfriend being pregnant and still wanted to marry her. Who became a maniac on realising she got married. Who was so crazy for her to give-up home, defy his father rather than moving on. Those who think the hero slapping his girlfriend as a decimation of feminism, fail to recognise his unconditional love and probably has never been in a relationship where the guy and girl are crazy about each other.",Non-Political

I was reading Rudyard Kipling's *The Miracle of Purun Bhagat* https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/kipling/rudyard/jungle2/chapter3.html. There's this statement about the price to be paid if you travel overseas, or you lose your caste/varna. If Rudyard Kipling wrote this just 100 years back, it was common knowledge back then too. I decided to read further about it, and no wonder that Indians were tied down to the land and not able to expand, because of the system in Hinduism called ""Samudrolanghana"". It also shows how Hindus looked down on outsiders and those not of the religion.

So I can take your bouquets and brickbats in equal measure. I don't piss in my pants at the thought of down votes.

Why is /r/india so fond of downvoting anyways? Down vote the trolls if you have too but down voting informed or semi informed opinion into oblivion which does not fit into the jigsaw of your thinking is not the mark of intellect. It rather displays dogmatism of the rabid kind.

Any comment which does not fit into the line of thinking gets blown to smithereens while circle jerkers get placed on a pedestal.

Randiyans down vote erudite commentary while silly, mindless trolls like the prostitute instance or English speaking magnetize the redditors, being the center of their attention for hours to together.

When I log into reddit, this morning the top three posts are all graphic pictures. I've to go down to the 7^th post to find something to read. This is primarily a product of the uncouth attitude of this subreddit. Most people have stopped sharing intelligent posts, because well it's human nature to look for an audience and appreciation and unfortunately /r/india has none of either. Even if I have something interesting and enlightening to share, which primarily involves reading , i prefer /r/republicofindia. And I sense a similar tendency has overcome most people who have grown into a state of torpor out of the sheer mindless nonsense which circulates. TL;DR has become an excuse for lack of cognitive ability or sheer stupor.

So in turn you have cunt face redditors posting x-posts from here and there. If i want a post from incredibleIndia I will go there and have a look. There's a reason a separate subreddit exists.

Any state that functions on freebies in free market only kills itself. I wish we take a lesson from countries such as Argentina, which are run on subsidies, free healthcare and infrastructure. What has happened to countries and states like those : people have become inherently lazy, high unemployment, formalized labour is reduced to a few thousands (many people do not want to be legally working as they have to pay high taxes for benefits to people who do not want to work for it). Well, it is a choice a leader makes. You can a loved leader of today (because of the freebies) but you will be a joke of tomorrow as you would have brought down a healthy(economically) state with you. 
&nbsp;


It might relieve some people of paying electricity and water bills today however, the future the generation will suffer unemployment and lack of competitive resources thanks to policies you are perpetuating. 
&nbsp;


Aam Aadmi Party was supposed to be a party with a difference, but even AAP has decided to play politics. In the short sightedness of increasing a vote bank the party is going to kill the economy of the state. People are not fools to not see through this.
&nbsp;


Instead of free water, free electricity, free roads, free security shouldn't you/ AAP be concentrating to empowering people to pay for those facilities rather than making them beggars(people getting services for free). How to empower people is by creating jobs. Jobs given on the basis of merit not caste/senoirity/political agenda.
&nbsp;


Like I said, it is a choice a leader makes. To be loved today and hated in the future.
It is your choice Arvind Kejriwal.

If Modi were to become the prime minister of India, he himself can be quite a concern for US as in India will have an incorruptible, proud patriot leading the country who won't be anyone's puppet. Modi doesn't deal with kids' gloves when it comes to terrorism or foreign elements threatening India's security. That will disturb the normal order for US.

The south is leaps and bounds ahead of the North in every way possible. The social indicators of the South like birth rate and even sex ratio are close to western EU standards.But the North have around 10 times worse rates.Economically, cities like Bangalore, Mumbai,Hyderabad and Chennai would have easily been cities of the size of NY,London and other HUGE cities in the world and they would be held to the same standard as well. I'm not going to deny that the South isn't perfect but a lot of the problems would have been solved if the South separated and dealt with it. As it is,there are place like the South Canara district which are so aware and educated that political parties can't put the usual crooks and idiots up for election because the people will actually vote for NOTA.

Aside from developmental purposes, the South is also culturally different from the North. And the people from North realised it was better staying in the south because of climate, job opportunity etc and now the number of north Indians are so huge in the south.Why is this a problem? They try and impose Hindi in a way, their families might have lived here for 10-20 years and they will hardly know a few words in the regional language.They expect everyone to speak Hindi with them even though over here English is probably more common than Hindi and is usually 2nd behind the local language.Other than this, they also brought the problems the North had in terms of social indicators here.

If you ask most people, I can guarantee they will say that Hindi is the national language of the country even though we have around 30 national languages, if you look at the country as a whole and not just by population, English is far more popular. When the country was formed after independence, the makers of the constitution convinced the southern states to join by promising them that the culture of the North wouldn't be imposed and made rules to accommodate this. Despite this the people continue to ignore our culture, lifestyle and values and expect everyone to follow them.

There is absolutely no reason the South should continue to be a part of the country. the country has fucked the South and expect to continue to live off the South's work and success.

I know this seems like a rant which it is to some extent (I saw an article that said a tourist was raped in Delhi and the govt says that they have no problem ensuring safety of women in the country. This is obviously a lie and they aren't even trying to deal with the problem.This happens in the south, not gonna deny but personally I feel more people here know why this crime has to be stopped and are willing to help while in my visits to the north the people itself, barring a few who are more educated and exposed to other culture, do not understand the problem. There are still towns where the govt knows families have children till they get a male child and kill all the female babies and do nothing about it because they don't see a reason to stop it), but honestly why should the South stay a part of the country? Are there people who are truly from the south who believe that there is no merit to exit?

[Article from April 2014]

- Between 2009-10 and 2011-12, non-agricultural employment grew rapidly.
- Between 1999-2000 to 2004-2005, the number of non-agricultural jobs created was 7.5 million per annum.  
- Between 2004-2005 and 2011-12 again, the number of non-agricultural jobs created was 7.5 million per annum.  

- The important point is that millions left agricultural work after 2004-05 on account of many new opportunities. Although 37 million persons left agriculture during the periods 2004-05 and 2011-12, they found work in non-agricultural activities, both rural and urban. In comparison, 20 million new workers joined agriculture between 1999-2004.

- Agriculture has grown much faster since 2005. In fact, during the 11th Plan, agricultural output grew at 3.2 per cent per annum (2007-12) on average, despite crippling drought in 2009-10 and despite the number of people leaving agriculture.  
- The reduction of people working in agricultural work is the first time in our history.   
- Services jobs grew by 11 million, and manufacturing employment increased by a remarkable nine million in two years alone (2009-10 and 2011-12), although manufacturing employment fell in absolute terms by three million between 2004-05 and 2009-10. 

- For the first time in the history of India, there was a decline in the absolute numbers of the poor after 2004-05; until then for nearly 30 years (1973-74 to 2004-5), there was a fall in the percentage, but not in the absolute numbers of the poor (322 million poor in 1973-74 and 302 million poor in 2004-05, by the Lakdawala poverty line). The decline in poverty was driven by a rise in real wages.  
- The new non-poor demand simple manufactured consumer goods: processed food (biscuits, milk), leather goods (shoes, sandals), furniture (plastic chairs/tables, wooden furniture), textiles, garments and mobiles. All these product areas and services saw a dramatic increase in employment between 2009-10 and 2011-12, primarily because these simple, low-end products (at least those consumed by the new non-poor) are produced in the unorganised sector, using labour-intensive methods.

http://archive.financialexpress.com/news/column-the-myth-of-jobless-growth/1099529/1 [ Article from Apr 2013 ]

-  It is inconceivable that such a massive increase in GDP (over four times) can take place without commensurate growth in employment, yet the government of India persists with this myth. This has been accentuated by incomplete and inconsistent data published by various government departments.

India has 15 crore net users as of now , every year we are predicted to add another 5 crores and they would be majorly from lower caste since upper caste net presence has saturated already .

I demand Modi to immediately implement these ideas. I have already defended most of these ideas so i wouldn't spend much time doing the same thing here again.

Here are my one-line rational behind each of these ideas:

1. Pan India unemployment allowance: Modi promised jobs and he failed.

2. reservation in Private sector: Discriminatory hiring, unequal access to institutional, social and financial resources due to caste-system.

3. special status to Bihar and other Eastern-states: To make for the loss because of freight-equalization policy.

4. Re-allocation of MP seats: Allocation of MPs should reflect current demography for governance reasons.

There is lot of action on the ground.

* Increased taxes on petrol by around 8-10%. Petrol now costs more than aviation fuel.
* Increased service tax.
* Cleaned India on one particular day last year. It became so clean that it hasn't needed any cleaning since then. There is a plan to levy a 2% tax on everything to do this photo op annually.
* Got a nuclear treaty signed with US. His party had prevented the previous government from doing this for 7-8 years.
* Increased Foreign Investment in insurance to 51%. His party had prevented the previous government from doing this.
* Increased train fares. His party had prevented the previous government from doing this inspite of the railways being subsidised heavily and running at a loss.
* Put Modiji's photo on tea cups used in Railways.
* Allowing Foreign investment in retail. His party had prevented the previous government from doing this.
* Got clean chits for some party members (including the head of his party) who were facing criminal cases in the courts.
* Appointed a TV serial actress who dropped out of school at 17 as the head of our Education ministry.
* IIT Delhi Director resigned. Chairman of Board of Governors of IIT, Bombay resigned. Delhi University Vice Chancellor resigned.
* Arranged a 1 billion $ loan from a Government bank for the guy who provided him with aircraft and copters for his campaigning.
* Trying to push a GST bill through parliament. This is the same bill Modiji had opposed for 12 years when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat.
* Went full steam ahead on a National ID card project which he had criticised the previous government for heavily.
* Did Biryani politics with Pakistan.
* Renamed several programs of the previous government and relaunched them as new programs.
* Took credit for a few achievements of the previous government.
* The previous government had deregulated petrol prices. But the new government now controls deregulated fuel prices by tweaking taxes on petrol so that the price at the pump is regulated.
* Pressurized Governors appointed by Previous Government to resign. Those who didn't were transferred to whatever is the Indian equivalent of Siberia. Mizoram has seen 7 Governors in 8 months because of this.
* Announced India as an unstoppable force in Science by leaking out the fact that India invanted plastic surgery, planes and inter galactic travel.
* Appointed the kind of censor board committee which made us miss Leela Samson and her gang.
* Gave Padma Bhushan to the founder of the TV channel which is the pride of India - IndiaTV.

But Modiji's presidency shouldn't be just seen at the national level. His party has also done several great things at the state level.

* Banned beef in Maharashtra. You can be jailed for 5 years if you are caught with beef.
* They have a cow ministry in Rajasthan.
* Cows are going to be issued Aadhaar National ID cards in Rajasthan. Hoof Prints may be used for biometric authentication.
* Cows may also be provided photo id cards in Maharashtra.
* Religious Hindu texts to be made as mandatory study in schools in Haryana.
* No FIRs against bureaucrats, MLAs in Maharashtra with prior approval from the Government.
* Moving towards Doordarshan autonomy in Gujarat. One guy who reported news about Jashodaben's RTI application was transferred to the Andamans.
* Reservation for Marathas in Maharashtra. Aren't even an unprivileged community.

I see nothing wrong in prohibiting women or men in a particular temple or mosque or church. Or in certain sections of said mosque church temple. 



--Hinduism is made of thousands of different sects, belief systems, ideas etc so much so that if anyone tries to limit it to a set of beliefs like the RSS or. BJP sometimes do.. They will be in the wrong. 


-- This particular sect States that the deity is a celibate and does not want to come in contact with fertile women.

Why should it matter that it is stupid or intelligent or smart or foolish. 

It is a belief. All religious beliefs are man made and stupid according to me. But people are free to believe whatever they want to. This is religious freedom. 

-- As long as nobody is imposing their beliefs on others, and the belief is not causing harm to others...
We should respect it. We can critique it if we want to. But we shouldn't impose our own belief system onto others forcefully. 


-- Now somebody will say that this prohibition is causing harm to women. How? 


If you are a genuine devotee of Lord Ayappa or whatever the lords name is.. And you believe in this particular sect. You will believe that he doesn't want to come in contact with women. So why would any women want to do what the lord specifically did not want them to do. It is like a jain person doing animal sacrifice. Going completely against the basic tenet of the sect. 


That is why no women believing in the sect wants to go there.


And if you don't like this sect and its prohibition of visiting the deity in the temple, then change your sect, change your religion, become atheist...do whatever you want. 


And I don't see any harm if you don't get to go to this particular temple where the deity specifically wishes you not come. 


Go to other temples man. Or pray from the base of the temple or whatever. 


-- But what if I want to reform the religion, one might ask. I want to have a lord ayappa sect which welcomes women to touch the deity and take selfies with deity etc etc. Or whatever reform one wants to have. 


So start your own temple. Your own sect. Nobody is stopping you. If somebody stops you, then they will be wrong, and I will fight for your right to your religious freedom. 


Start your own lord ayappa sect and add many other idols of women around it. Make it only for women. Do whatever it is that you want to. Preach your new sect. 


For example- Homosexuality is prohibited in all abrahamic religions. 
A gay person cannot become the leader of a mosque or a church (technically).


You cannot force Delhi Jama Masjid or Kalkaji Church to allow a gay person to become the imam or the pastor who will lead the prayer. This is against religious freedom. 


But at the same time, gay Muslims and Christians can open up lgbt mosques and churches and welcome all people there.

-- Forcing your own belief systems onto religious sects and beliefs is wrong and stupid. 


If there is a bali sect among Hindus where goats and cattle are sacrificed, it is improper for other vegetarian Hindus to force them to stop their balis. 


And more so for the judiciary to meddle into the affairs of religion. 


You can try and reform. You can try and convince. You can start your own counter sect. But you cannot force.

This is not a party that wants any good for you. Please don't get fooled by the type of politics that is being played. Wake up and smell the coffee. Read history. Read about these organizations and their agendas. I'm not telling you to vote for Congress neither am I a Pakistani (anti national) preaching hate just to see my country in thrash. For God sake stop this nonsense. 


I request and plead my fellow citizens to start taking immediate stances and fight for the country by spreading the truth. What's happening across the nation is traumatizing. People are being lynched , economy is crashing , the media has been lying about the situation in kashmir and so on. I was expecting this page to be biased to one common agenda but it turned out to be much open than the Pak one. When I questioned in the Pak page about the stances and double standards of their govt, I got suspended from posting. This subreddit here has been a major model that allows both sides of the coin an equal share! 


There have already been so many people showing concern towards the path that we have taken. It's a major crisis as we all know. It is the essence of democracy to speak truth to the power and this must be done no matter what! 
We have a whole generation to look after and we can't afford any kind of war or b.s now!


The Kaveri river has been calling us. It's drying out! Floods have become a frequent tragic every year and it's on us my people to save the nation. Imagine what would happen if a war occurs! Imagine the after effects. These are not the medieval or ancient times where people fought with swords and arrows. We have nuclear weapons on either side. Imagine the after effects of a WAR.  Imagine how many of our jawaans and citizens will loose their lives. 



We as a nation stand by our jawaans, THATS FOR SURE. AND WE SHOULD! But the political elite have been manipulating their positions in the eyes of the people. DONT LET THIS HAPPEN. 



The least you can do now is speak the truth. The truth in the end of the day always wins! So keep all your biases aside and see your fellow citizens who endures the same hardships as you and start becoming responsible citizens.

Was going through Zomato on my friend's phone (who doesn't order so much) and surprise surprise, her phone's getting ALLL the offers. ZOMATO for RS 100 off and there's a new one which I had no idea about, ZOMATO30, which gives you 30% off on orders above 300.

First, I used to like indians, but now I don't. Because in the past ten years there is has been massive growth in Silicon Valley for indians. They are becoming bolder and trying to behave the way the way they do in india, meaning trying to establish dominance over other local groups. 

The women especially are quite abrasive and arrogant. They think men of other ethnicities are attracted to them; which is a joke.  

The people are racist and its culturally based. They think they can treat people a certain way based on their social grouping. Short, fat, white, asian. They won't deal with you alone. They'll not confront you alone.  They are cowards and pussies.

The men are insecure because they can't get pussy. They are mad at east asians because the men are acceptable to non-asian women as dating partners.

1663,An Estimate of Bhai's size. [NP],0,3ntfq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ntfq2/an_estimate_of_bhais_size_np/,17,"Hi friends, yesterday night I saw a bunch of crazies comment on how Salman got robbed. Now I don't know why you idiots call him 'Bhai' or think he is a virgin? Most of the parent comments were about his virginity and they got upvoted without even wondering if his claims of virginity were true?

Anyway, I wondered why four girls would rob him and why he would be reluctant on filing a complaint? I mean, naturally girls take selfies and do tweets and get the hell out of there. But no, not this time, it could only mean one thing, that your 'BHAI'  had sex with all the four girls and one of them took his wallet as a souvenir. And that could  be the only  reason he didn't file a complaint.

But then I wondered how big is his dick that four girls would give themselves up so easily? I did Google searches and found no info on Bollywood actor's dick sizes. There's an abundance of info on Hollywood actor's dick sizes but not Bollywood. For example take *Ashton Ketchup*, he rants on Two and Half Men about how big his dick is, but in reality it's small. No wonder he married Mila Kunis, I mean that's the closest he'll get to an Asian! Were as, take Liam Nesson, it is said that once  a hooker dropped her wine bottle and ran upon seeing his dick.

But no info about Bhai's dick. So I took it upon myself to find out! The average penis size of us Indians is below 4 inches. So Bhai damn sure had to have a bigger dick than the rest of us. I mean, he needs it to slap his co-stars with it!

So I went and googled images of Bhai. And if you see here in this [album](http://imgur.com/a/9tHW2), you'll see that Bhai always has a bulge. It means that he has a big dick and is not just a *shower* but also a *grower*. 

Who else has a bulge like him? [BECKHAM](http://imgur.com/D2vxCBD), and Beckham is disputed to have a dick upwards of 8 inches, so Bhai too has a dick that big, if physics and common sense is applied here. 

They say women know about a man  the moment they lay their eyes on them. Those four poor girls were just a victim of greed. The saw his dick and couldn't control themselves.  

Now why has Bhai not been able to sustain a relationship? It could only mean two things, they are as follows:  

* As Bhai got older and wiser, his thirst for better sex didn't stop either. And no one women could have satisfied him!

* Or, he, like we see in Media is very aggressive and volatile and may have fetishes like BDSM. In his endeavours of BDSM, Bhai probably went to harsh and rough on them and therefore his relationships ended.

So to sum up, Bhai has a dick in the size range of **8-8.5 inches** (twice the country's average) and this is the reason why he displays such charismatic and confident behavior on T.V.

A man is lynched in Dadri and very few truly empathise with the grief of a poor family. Instead, rabble rousers continue to pursue their agenda to decide on what people should eat: the obvious aim is to stir a Hindu Muslim divide. Ink is thrown at a public figure, a music concert of one the greatest ghazal singers is stalled: the debate isn't about free artistic expression but becomes about who is 'patriotic' and who is not. Sahitya Akademi award winners return their awards and their right to dissent is not accepted; instead, they are abused and targeted as 'pseudo-intellectuals'. The new buzzword is 'selective outrage': if you didn't outrage about a crime against a Hindu you have no moral right to outrage when a Muslim is killed. Killings it seems have become a zero sum game: your riot versus mine. We don't spare anyone who might wish to break from the official narrative that seeks to promote majoritarianism in the garb of silencing all those who might insist on a greater reach out to the more vulnerable minority groups. When Naseeruddin Shah, arguably the finest stage actor of our generation, says he is being made conscious of his Muslim identity for the first time, being dubbed 'anti national' for attending a seminar, you wonder what kind of a civil society are we bequeathing to the next generation.

* 2 Indians put the language of the oppressive british regime, English, as one of the ""national"" languages. The ""good schools"" are christian schools with emphasis on english. 

Sure, the tamils don't speak hindi... then why not LEARN hindi instead of english. (hindi is closer to tamil as a language than english).

ENGLISH IS A NECESSARY LANGUAGE TO BE FLUENT IN, but it isn't required to be your primary language. (look at germany, japan, france, sweden..etc).

* 3 Many Indian Moslims think they're not even ""Indian"" ethnically. They believe they apparently are descended from ""arabs/persians"". (maybe 5% of them are... but this thinking is frighteningly more wide-spread than 5%)

* 4 Some Indian Christians tend to try to be more ""english"" or ""american"" RATHER THAN ""christian"". (I said some, not all) 

* 5 Many Hindus hate their scriptures, religion. Yes, many scriptures are clearly frightening (some puranas). But have you read a book as open-minded and philosophically rich as the Gita? or the ISA upanishad?

1742,"When Germany is Christian, Why India is NOT Hindu ?",1,1gd550,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1gd550/when_germany_is_christian_why_india_is_not_hindu/,27,"Though I live in India since long, there are still some points that I find hard to understand – for example why many educated Indians become agitated when India is considered as a Hindu country. The majority of Indians are Hindus. India is special because of its ancient Hindu tradition. Westerners are drawn to India because of it. Why then is there this resistance by many Indians to acknowledge the Hindu roots of their country?

This attitude is strange for two reasons. First, those educated Indians seem to have a problem only with ‘Hindu’ India, but not with ‘Muslim’ or ‘Christian’ countries. In Germany for example, only 59 percent of the population are registered with the two big Christian Churches (Protestant and Catholic), however, the country is bracketed under ‘Christian countries’. Angela Merkel, the Chancellor, stressed recently the Christian roots of Germany and urged the population ‘to go back to Christian values’. In 2012, she postponed her trip to the G-8 summit for a day to address the German Catholic Day. Two major political parties carry ‘Christian’ in their name, including Angela Merkel’s ruling party.

Germans are not agitated that Germany is called a Christian country, though I actually would understand if they were. After all, the history of the Church is appalling. The so called success story of Christianity depended greatly on tyranny. “Convert or die”, were the options given not only to the indigenous population in America some five hundred years ago. In Germany, too, 1200 years ago, the emperor Karl the Great ordered the death sentence for refusal of baptism in his newly conquered realms. It provoked his advisor Alkuin to comment: ‘One can force them to baptism, but how to force them to believe?’

Those times, when one’s life was in danger if one dissented with the dogmas of the Church, are thankfully over. And nowadays many in the west do dissent and leave the Church in a steady stream – partly because they are disgusted with the less than holy behavior of Church officials and partly because they can’t believe in the dogmas, for example that ‘Jesus is the only way’ and that God sends all those who don’t accept this to hell.

And here comes the second reason why the resistance to associate India with Hinduism by Indians is difficult to understand. Hinduism is in a different category from the Abrahamic religions. Its history, compared to Christianity and Islam was undoubtedly the least violent as it spread in ancient times by convincing arguments and not by force. It is not a belief system that demands blind belief in dogmas and the suspension of one’s intelligence. On the contrary, Hinduism encourages using one’s intelligence to the hilt. It is an enquiry into truth, based on a refined (methods are given) character and intellect. It comprises a huge body of ancient literature, not only regarding Dharma and philosophy, but also regarding music, architecture, dance, science, astronomy, economics, politics, etc. If Germany or any other western country had this kind of literary treasure, it would be so proud and highlight its greatness on every occasion. When I discovered for example the Upanishads, I was stunned. Here was expressed in clear terms what I intuitively had felt to be true, but could not have expressed clearly. Brahman is not partial; it is the invisible, indivisible essence in everything. Everyone gets again and again a chance to discover the ultimate truth and is free to choose his way back to it. Helpful hints are given but not imposed.

In my early days in India, I thought that every Indian knew and valued his tradition. Slowly I realized that I was wrong. The British colonial masters had been successful in not only weaning away many of the elite from their ancient tradition but even making them despise it. It helped that the ‘educated’ class could no longer read the original Sanskrit texts and believed what the British told them. This lack of knowledge and the brainwashing by the British education may be the reason why many ‘modern’ Indians are against anything ‘Hindu’. They don’t realize the difference between western religions that have to be believed (or at least professed) blindly, and which discourage if not forbid their adherents to think on their own and the multi-layered Hindu Dharma which gives freedom and encourages using one’s intelligence.

Many of the educated class do not realize that on one hand, westerners, especially those who dream to impose their own religion on this vast country, will applaud them for denigrating Hindu Dharma, because this helps western universalism to spread in India. On the other hand, many westerners, including Church people, very well know the value and surreptitiously appropriate insights from the vast Indian knowledge system, drop the original source and present it either as their own or make it look as if these insights had been known in the west.

Rajiv Malhotra of Infinity Foundation has done painstaking research in this field and has documented many cases of “digestion” of Dharma civilization into western universalism. He chose the term digestion, as it implies that that which is being digested (a deer for example) is in the end no longer there, whereas the ‘digester’ (a tiger) becomes stronger. Similarly, Hindu civilization is gradually being depleted of its valuable, exclusive assets and what is left is called inferior.

If only missionaries denigrated Hindu Dharma, it would not be so bad, as they clearly have an agenda which discerning Indians would detect. But sadly, Indians with Hindu names assist them because they wrongly believe that Hinduism is inferior to western religions. They belittle everything Hindu instead of getting thorough knowledge. As a rule, they know little about their tradition except what the British told them, i.e. that the major features are caste system and idol worship. They don’t realize that India would gain, not lose, if it solidly backed its profound and all inclusive Hindu tradition. The Dalai Lama said some time ago that already as a youth in Lhasa, he had been deeply impressed by the richness of Indian thought. “India has great potential to help the world,” he added. When will the westernized Indian elite realize it?

**Now here is the thing :** As we and the whole world knows pakistan's primary defense/offence is terrorism, it's part of who they are (it's indoctrinated through the web of madrasahs, just read about hafiz saeed).

All they have to do is transport guns and weapons to kashmir, **Before** this whole mess, the people of kashmir wouldn't accept any such weapon at large. But now they don't know if they are safe or not, and specially they don't know if their kids are safe or not. 
**Now** i think most of the kashmiris would accept weapons if they had a chance. Pakistan Govt. and army both would be more than eager to do this.

And then only a fire is needed to start a wildfire (something like Kathua rape case).

This blog was intentionally badly written to make it appear dubious.

Then the rebuttal from TVF was carefully worded to provoke people and appear insensitive. At this point, the FB post was planned to be posted.

Police said so far 98 have succumbed and around 40 more are under treatment in various government and private hospitals since the past four days.

The tragedy occurred after scores of slum residents in Malwani, a northern suburb, bought and consumed methanol-infused hooch from local bootleggers. The concentration of toxic methanol in the hooch was high enough to send more than a hundred consumers to the hospital with complaints of breathlessness, stomach aches and failing vision. The death toll is now higher than that of Mumbai’s last major hooch catastrophe in 2004, when 89 people had died in Vikhroli.

3. See acting by actors in low budget cinema, but not in mainstream cinema. Example - Everyone is talking about FAN is this, fan is that.

I think it all started with the Modi govt. banning NGOs. So, I was one of those who thought that this was a retrograde move. A lot of NGO's do good - I know for a fact that a lot of implicit missionary activities goes on behind the scenes, but I have no problem if people convert to christianity so that they can make bread. The christian missionaries might have ulterior motives - but its still fine with me. The poor of this country are better of with bread and god, than neither. 

I think all this media manipulation started of post this act of hte Modi govt.. When NGO's were pumping money into India, there was a relatively easy channel to 'wake up' our population to the service of Jesus. But the ban on NGO's put water to by and large this act which had been going unhindered for a couple of decades now. The media manipulation that we are seeing now, is partly a response to this act of the Modi govt. and partly a newer and more effective strategy to bring Jesus into our lives. It is this more effective strategy which has rankled me most.

Even though Indians might see themselves a secular country, the world - and by and large the western world, does not. For the west India is broadly Hindu - the failings of India are by and large the failings of Hinduism. The media strategy is amazingly effective because it does not need to direct Hindusim - what it does instead is direct India itself and it is left to the imagination of the audience to make that connect with Hindusim. This, as most marketing gurus will tell you, is one of the most effective marketing ploys. Do not sell water to the thirsty, but glorify the beauty of your wells and let people make that connect in their minds. 

I think it is broadly known that a lot of agencies which funds NGO's in India also have significant interests in the media. Add to that delipidated law and order infrastructure in the country and lot of medieval social/cultural mores still present in parts of the society makes India the perfect hot spot for these kind of shenanigans. A population which is acutely aware of their failings is the perfect ground for the harvesting of souls - the societies which come from Jesus do not have any such social ills and this connect is left for the audience to make for themselves.

The biggest success of this strategy was obviously the delhi rape incident and the documentary behind it. However, I would like to give credit to the home minister Rajnath singh, who acted like a rank amateur here and walked into the trap by banning it. The documentary was shoddily made and it would have died a natural death had it not been for the home minister who is probably the weakest link in the modi govt. However, credit should also be given to NDTV who went on a rampage and raped India in broad daylight. Barkha dutt defending India was either born out of her realisation that her game is being outed and so that she can salvage whatever little credibility is left.

The thing is that this game is not over yet and everyday I am reading news reports which try to play up this angle. There was something on bachelors not getting rents or maybe it was muslims. Then there was the thing about a muslim guy being denied jobs. The thing is that in a country as diverse as India, these things will always happen in a certain number. Even then India is significantly less discriminatory then for example say America which has incredible amount of rascism between blacks, whites and browns.",Non-Political

A Historical recap for Trivedi Goel.,0,38i1b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/38i1b7/the_most_successful_kings_of_india_were_all_non/,26,"1) Let us analyse the greatest of Kings of India and abroad and the most foolish of them from pre - medieval and Medeival History.

One thing will be clear globally

1) The Most successful ones were (So to speak Pagans), but they were not Banias (Followers of Vedas, Puranas  or from any Gotra)but independent men who believed in meritocracy.

2)The most foolish ones, the least successful ones were all Vedic.

The backdrop of this analysis is the most basic classification of people. Devas and Asuras. Anyone who followed the Vedic system and adhered to the principles of the Banias and Brahmins were connoted as Devas and the ones who did not were connoted as Asuras as per the more populous Gotras(Then and till today, the combined gotra populations make the Gotra groups of India one of the most widely entrenched, populous and vast social networks of non productive vegetables the planet has ever seen).We can consider the world as a one whole instead of nation states, in that era. We do not analyse prehistory,in a time when Vishnu and Ram and other Vedic Gods did not exist but medieval History. We will pit Human Asuras (So to speak) against Vedic Gods(So to speak) and compare their achievements. 

1) Ram

Genus :  Bania (Indo Aryan)

Achievements: Did nothing, built no monument, unverified birth location, convinced one group of natives(Marathi monkeys as per Ramayan) to attack a smaller group of natives( South Indians) to avenge the shame of his wife running away with the Richer, Technologically Advanced, Aerial Car Driving Southern King after his wife crossed the Lakshman Rekha. Finally committed suicide after dumping his unchaste wife.(Aum).

2)Parashuram

Genus: Indo Aryan (Bania)
Achievements :  Did nothing,built no monuments, settled some Banias into the southern Lands of Kerala. Murdered his mother who was tempted by Rich native men, unverified existence.

3) Vamana:

Genus :  Dwarf Brahmin ( Indo Aryan), came to Kerala with a group of Brahmins, asked King Mahabali for land and then back-stabbed him by exploding Bania population.

4) Krishna

Genus :  3rd class Indo Aryan(Mixed Blood between Native and Indo Aryan)

Achievements: Did nothing, instigated war and propounded already well established Cosmic Philosophy from the Sramana system and packaged it well.Built nothing.Died by a hunters arrow.

5) Other small Vedic Fish : Bimbisara, Ajatashatru ..did nothing.

Non Vedic Heroes(Asuras):

1) Ashoka( Native, Bihari) -  Conquered all of Northern India until he converted to Buddhism.

2) Kanishka,(A Kushan King, Non Vedic) - Conquered all of Northern India till the Tarim Basin in Central Asia.

3)Alexander -  Conquered 1/2 the known world.Built Alexandria

4) Genghis Khan - Conquered the World

5)Cyrus the Great -  Conquered the Known World, built Persepolis

6) Ashurbanipal -  Conquered the known world, Built the Largest ancient Library.

7) Nebuchadenezzar -  Conquered the known world, sacked Jerusalem.

8) Sargon of Akkad -  Root for the word, Sarrukin (Now Sharukh Khan), built Sumeria and conquered the known world.

9) Raja Raja Chola -  Conquered from South of India till the Ganges, built Gangai Konda Cholapuram and Brihadeeshwara Temple.

Akbar, Timur and others...not to mention.

We can consistently see why India is poor, because the Vedic people(Devas) and their kings are non inspirational and have noo aspiration and light in them. All they want to do is say Aum and drink milk,play holy with the cows ets and ban eggs in anganwadis. Basically, Goels lives the life of an insect and then come back to live the life of an insect.And India stays, malnourished, backward and poor.For there is noo light in the Vedas.

* AAP opposition to nuclear power plants supporting marxist/maoist agenda

* Harmful socialist/quasi-communist model of economy based upon freebies which has been discarded even in communist China & USSR

* The U-turns on no personal security, ministerial housing, misleading promises on ""free water"" , ""cheap electricity"" .

* Shameless refusal of Arvind to convict Congress politicians after getting their support

* Cheap marketing gimmicks like metro rides which delayed 3 trains without doing any good to anybody.

* Communist CMs of West Bengal and Kerala acted honest and didn't even took full salaries. What good it did to economy of both states ? Both states are nearly bankrupt with no industry or external investments.

* Kamal Farouqui who quit Samajwadi Party and who is a notorious communalist is an AAP member.

* Prashant Bhushan wants a plebiscite and free Kashmir

* Binayak Sen, a convicted naxal is an AAP member

* Yogendra Yadav, active NAC member, Rahul Gandhi's political coach and a known maoist, is an AAP member

* Shazia Ilmi, senior AAP leader, was caught on tape for accepting bribes in exchange for political favours after elections 

* Arvind Kejriwal received funds from Ford Foundation which is a known CIA front

* Arvind Kejriwal wants urdu as a second language 

* Arvind Kejriwal supported terrorists killed at Batla House encounter which he called a fake encounter but they were proven to be Indian Mujahideen terrorists

* Arvind Kejriwal asked for votes from maulana Tauqeer Raza Khan who put a bounty on Taslima Nasreen's head and said that one day Pakistan will rule India.

Even if intentions of AAP are right, their way of working by distributing freebies and more central control is not the way to go. It has never worked anywhere in the world.

To put this into perspective, I watch 100+ movies every year and this year I have already watched 104 movies. Anyway, I stopped watching bollywood movies after 2012(Jab Tak Hain Jaan's story gave my brain permanent retardation and incurable cancer). Anyway, a junior was recommending me Kabir Singh since 1st July, and I was reluctant and hesitant to watch this movie. So today I went and watched this movie. 
Here's my review and ratings -
Rating 2/5...
The cinematography and acting was awesome. Shahid Kapoor's acting was 5/5. I don't have any problem with the misogynistic, drug abusive, violent portrayal of Kabir Singh,because it's just a character. The first half of the movie felt like I was watching something new and refreshing from Bollywood. But things started getting downhill as soon Preeti got married. The story went down the drain, like why was he allowed to perform surgeries in intoxicated states? And he gets punished when he didnt want to perform the surgery but he had no other options, then the logic started going out of the window, suddenly this and that happens, suddenly when he plans to move one, Preeti is conveniently single/seperatee and she didn't even let the other guy touch him. And they get married and Happyzzz Endingzzzz!!! Cliched bollywood. Omg!!! For once why cant they write something different and why are most of the Bollywood's storyline pure garbage??? Like who eats up this shit and doesnt get brain cancer??

Wait a minute.....

And what exactly is the other option? Not allowing divorce at all? Feminists talk about consent. Like consent can be granted and then taken back. But when it comes to marriage, once you get married you cannot get out of marriage without the other person allowing to it. 

Considering India where there are loads of arranged marriages and many forced or persons don't exactly know their partners properly, not allowing divorce without partners consent is not exactly progressive. It's just like forced marriages. I haven't seen anyone speak against this oppression of forcing people to stay in marriages. All this talk of banning unilateral divorce for men instead of talking about allowing unilateral divorce for women shows this issue is not about barbaric laws. It's about muslims. 

Triple talaq is just instantaneous unilateral divorce. It's not medieval or barbaric. It's pretty progressive. The only objection which women's rights activists can say against it is that it's available only for men. But when instead of that, when they talk about banning unilateral divorce for men also, I cannot take them seriously. 

Its not just men, Muslim women also have options to end marriage unilaterally. There are already two provisions in the Muslim Personal Law. 

1) Talaq e Tafweez - Delegated divorce. The wife demands right of divorce when getting married. If this right is included in the marriage contract, then she can issue divorce just like triple talaq. Only thing is that it's not included by default. 

2) Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage(Khula) - When the wife cannot tolerate her husband or doesn't like him she can file for divorce. This doesn't require the consent of her husband. Also it's available only under Muslim Personal Law. 

In all other personal laws one cannot get out of marriage without mutual consent. You are forced to stay in marriage against your will. I don't see why nobody is speaking up against such forced marriages?

In fact BJP government dropped the Irretrievable breakdown of marriage for grounds for divorce.

http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bill-to-make-divorce-easier-may-be-dropped/article6910089.ece


>Groups opposing the Marriage Laws (Amendment) Bill contend that it will cause an increase in ""illegitimate and live-in relations and thereby a fall of the institution of marriage and family values.""

Since then the Supreme Court has on a number of occasions recommended the inclusion of irretrievable breakdown of marriage as a ground for divorce.

BJP does kulcha nonsense and opposes amendment of Hindu law while acting as women's rights activist in case of Muslim personal law.

If a woman dies within less than 3 years of marriage, the suspicion is immediately on her in-laws.

If there is a divorce, laws have been changed to ensure that women receive half of all the wealth of the husband. This includes all the inherited ancestral property of the husband. There is no scope for pre-nuptial agreements in India. They are not recognized. This means, your savings, your home, your ancestral home and savings, everything has to be sold and split into half.

Men, on the other hand, do not share in the inherited property of their wives, according to this law.

Here's a thought provoking discussion on this bill on NDTV

A lot of women in the major cities of India are heavily into smoking and drinking these days. 45% of women in Mumbai smoke as per DNA. That's almost half the women.

Drinking in women on the rise:

http://m.indiatoday.in/story/drink-dependence-up-in-urban-indian-women/1/235418.html

Most want to pursue a career. If you're looking for someone who will look after your home, it will be near impossible to find an educated girl who will do so. Most cringe at the thought of cooking. Many will want maids and ayahs to look after children.

Busy careers leave you with little time together (Read 'no sex'). If you want to get married to have children, most women are also postponing children so they can pursue a career:

http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/05/more-indian-working-women-aborting-motherhood/

Many women are hitting menopause earlier because of the stress from pursuing careers. Some are going through menopause while still in their twenties. It is impossible for women to give birth after menopause. This means women are fertile for a lesser period. This also means difficulty in having kids and a much shorter sex life, over before it even begins sometimes. Post-menopause the quality of sex goes down and mood swings are common. Women also age rapidly after hitting menopause. If you marry a thirty year old woman, she may already have had her menopause for all you know.

I am an atheist, and I respect other people's beliefs. I don't mind if people are religious, but in India the prevalent orthodoxy is harming the country. [Section 377 is cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_India).
I've seen many reports online saying India is a very racist country, and whenever I saw these reports I used to think ""Kya chutiyapa, India is a VERY diverse and VERY accepting country"", but I've noticed that we are accepting because we have to be. The majority of the population is bigoted and racist, but in subtle socially acceptable ways.

Or teaching them to attack and kill anyone that does not belong to their own religion? Why the violent programming? Why the fear indoctrination? Why the child abuse?

Fuck you all for believing in this made up bullshit called Religion. You know what I think about your religions? I think it is a waste of time, I think it is just another fairytale for childish adults who cant grasp the concept of death. They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

**Background Reading**

* [Kodaikanal mercury poisoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodaikanal_mercury_poisoning)
* [Unilever's Mercury Fever](http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=624)

The summary of these articles would be as follows,

A company called Ponds moved its thermometer factory from the US to Kodaikanal in 1982.

HLL took over Ponds, ran operations till 2001.

A shitton of Mercury was found onsite and Greenpeace and other NGO's have been on the case.

What has been ignored because of lack of visibility is the plight of my village (which I will not name). My village sits right on the Kodai foothills and till the year 2000, our only source of water was a river that ran through the village. The river ran very close to the Ponds factory.

I have since 2001 been seeing an exponential death rate due to cancer. I myself lost my Grandmom to cancer in 2004, my tiny village of around 5,000 people has seen about 250 cancer deaths in just the past 5 years. That is a 5% mortality rate just from cancer. India has by comparision a 0.05% mortality rate. In other words my village has a 8500% greater mortality rate from cancer as compared the nation at large. 

If you factor in other variables like lifestyle caused cancer like Lung cancer because of smoking, and the fact that the vast majority of the 250 dead had none of these (or exposure to pollution for that matter) habits the numbers would look worse.

I want to bring this to the attention of somebody. I am not even looking at a case or a payout or anything, but just to bring this to some form of limelight. Do I just spam media outlets with an email, or should I contact GP / other NGO's...ideas are welcome.

Further studies in case you are interested.

[Studies and Reports on environmental pollution and public health hazard caused by Hindustan Lever in Kodaikanal](http://www.sipcotcuddalore.com/Kodaikanal/studies.htm). 

[Berijam lake](http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Blog/Guest-blog/hanging-in-the-mist-mercury-contamination-in-/blog/47184/).

>>Moss samples collected from trees surrounding the Berijam Lake, located 20 km from the factory, were also tested. Mercury levels were in the range of 0.2 µg/kg, while in Kodaikanal Lake the lichen and moss levels were 7.9 µg/kg and 8.3 µg/kg, respectively. Fish samples from the Kodaikanal Lake also showed mercury levels in the range of 120 to 290 mg/kg.

>>The fish in Kodaikanal Lake are contaminated, and this has caused the loss of livelihood for many people. Water as far as Madurai, a major city about 130kms from Kodaikanal, has been contaminated. That's no surprise because the contaminated water from the mountains was bound to flow onto the plains below.

This article talks about a town 130 Km's away and one that has no direct linkage to it via any river. My village is 20 kms from Berijam (about 50 km's by road), and the river in question, the [Varaha](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/varaha-river-to-flow-unimpeded/article2661510.ece) originated in Berijam. We are upstream, one of the first major settlements on the river, so the pollution and sewage that eventually killed the river really didn't matter to us. 

Edit - Throwaway for obvious reasons. Don't want this post to be sidetracked by petty partisanship.

edit 2 - Guys, have received PM's from Timesnow. Livemint has contacted the mods, and the mods have provided me a contact id. I have also been contacted (via) PM of an international NGO that looks into such cases.

To be honest I never expected this kind of traction and it is kind of scary now, but I am going to go ahead and email these three entities whatever info it is they require as well as put them onto people in my village.

edit 3 : 6th June 2015, 1300 IST - Guys,  I have initiated contact with 3 Indian Media outlets (big names) who reached out to me. I am now going to go by what they recommend next.

I will keep this thread updated as and when there is a d4evelopment. I have also been approached by 3 reddit users who kindly offered me their labs to test if I need so, but right now, I only have sketchy data to go by (as others here have pointed). I am going to co-operate with the media names and first see if something comes up via their more extensive due diligence.

Thank you. Just to reassure you (that I am not misusing the goodwill of the forum) the issue is real, maybe the cause is not mercury directly, but something is poisoning my village and my post was and remains well intentioned and not a ""troll post"" as a few have alleged via PM.",[R]eddiquette

These articles claim that she was in the midst of taking a “daredevil selfie” when the accident happened. Some even state that the youngsters were careless because they visited the beach despite there being numerous warnings against the same. Not only are these claims uncorroborated, but also they are false and present a version of events which did not take place at all, which only shows the sheer lack of responsibility and ethics displayed by the news channels and media houses concerned. 

The articles claim she fell 300ft from the top of a **lighthouse** after she **slipped** while taking a selfie. When in reality she was never on a lighthouse, and the she never slipped from said lighthouse and she was not taking a selfie on said lighthouse. The newspaper even got the location wrong, it mentions a different beach.

**Actual Events:**

Pranita, who was a student of National Law University, Jodhpur, was visiting Gokarna with four of her friends. They were at Kumta beach, and were sitting on some rocks which were about 10-15 feet above sea, when due to unexpected high tide, 3 of the youngsters, including the deceased, were flown away by a giant wave. Two of them were brought back to the shore by another wave, but the deceased, whose glasses had come off, continued to struggle as she held on to a rock for support she bravely struggled  and tried to swim for 45 mins. Unfortunately, she lost her grip, and was carried towards the deeper end of the sea by the waves. 
The friends promptly called the Police as well as the Management of the Hotel they were staying at, and proceeded to seek help from the local residents from a nearby village. However, they could not understand the youngsters’ plea for help, and by the time they did send some help, about forty minutes had already passed and the deceased was out of sight. She was brought back ashore on a boat by some of the local fishermen, and was pronounced dead by the authorities. Her body was taken for post-mortem and was handed over to her relatives afterwards.

**She was an amazing person**, extremely intelligent, she was the class topper and represented  India and NLUJ at prestigious events such as Jessup, she was kind and warm hearted. Her batchmates, teachers, seniors and even our Alumni have been rallying on facebook and on twitter, spreading the story of what really happened and contacting government officials (Arun jately among others) to take some action against these newspapers but I doubt they will listen to a hundred students. Her family has been mourning the loss of their great daughter, the last thing they need is her being mocked and laughed at for dying while taking a selfie.

All we want is that her family is not harassed by untrue depictions of the event which belittle the huge amount of respect that she has earned through her hardwork. 

I would request you to please check your facts before publishing such news articles.


This is also a reminder to all of  you that everytime you read a story where the victim died in this way might actually just be a cooked up tale. 

For Pranita.

Edit: Guys please, if something here offends you then please let me know, but please do not downvote this, we dont want her to be remembered this way, we want to get the true story out.

 Although words cannot express how greatful I am to Reddit India, words are all I have. So please accept my sincerest appreciation for what you guys have done today, you have, even though you are hundreds of miles from her parents , reduced their suffering in a small way. I and her friends will be eternally greatful  to reddit India for rallying behind this cause, when we band together we can achieve anything, and even though we sit behind screens we have the power to affect people in real life. Thankyou all for believing this story.

Thankyou guys so much once again, and thanks to the mods for being so cooperative. Thankyou ScoopWhoop for owning up to the mistake and not ignoring the truth when it came out. This post is now being circulated all over facebook and my college thanks to the efforts of reddit India.
 
 To Pranita, 
I hope you are in a better place, the college will forever miss seeing your radiating smile everyday.

To those reading, the best thing to do in honour of Pranitas memory is to ensure such places carry warning signs alerting visitors of dangers, as suggested by a redditor [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4m5l2k/my_friend_passed_away_and_toi_made_a_mockery_of/d3t7u30?context=3)

**EDIT:** As of 12PM IST (3rd June)  all the major newshouses have now either taken down the incorrect version, or posted the correct version. I will most likely stop updating this post, unless something major happens. 

Pls also note that I haven't disclosed my identity to anybody **not even to people in my college.**

Till now, only Indian Express has done the most in depth coverage and brought forth the true story, **I urge you all to read from [This Link](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/law-student-who-died-a-selfie-death-of-media-didnt-even-have-her-phone-with-her-2833051/ )**

I just came here to tell you guys that not all Pakistanis hate India and I know not all Indians hate Pakistan. However, we can all agree that both countries have different political differences but we don't hate the people. 
I currently live in the US and I have a lot of Indian friends. We are like family now. It's come to the point that we usually forget that we are from two different countries who hate each other. To us we are all the same. We are all from different religious backgrounds as well but it doesn't matter to us, there is no hatred whatsoever.

My father suffered a near fatal stroke and his recovery has been slow. We took discharge from the hospital and due to the rising cases of covid-19 and also the doctor suggested to take him home. 

But the fate was not on our side. He started coughing a little bit and had fever. We were still feeding him from feeding tube. Today his health was a little bit down so we decided to take him to the hospital and they screened all of us for Covid-19 due to the symptoms. Fortunately we all are negative. 

In the x-ray,it's showing that his left lung has collapsed completely. These last 2 months have really been awful for us especially for my mother as she isn't really coping well. 

The doctors have suggested there may be pneumonia or positional collapse involved in this case. 
Our family really is in dire need of your help. 

I beg you to contribute whatever you are comfortable with to the fundraiser. Please, we need your help and support. 

[Help my father recover](https://milaap.org/fundraisers/support-pawan-lonare?utm_source=shorturl)

Edit: Thiis is so overwhelming. Thanks for the awards. I'm sure with them the post visibility will increase and get us to the fundraiser amount in no time. Thank you each and everyone so tremendously. Thank you so much.

2142,Whats with this country and its standards?,2683,drehup,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/drehup/whats_with_this_country_and_its_standards/,748,"Apart from the obvious, trash everywhere, bikes on pavements, honking 24x7 even on empty roads, screaming yelling on streets for no reason, and even full-on riots when popular people die of natural causes (rajkumar in south india), even businesses are complete garbage.

Uber, Ola: No way to contact customer service directly, have to submit ticket and wait for them to call you. The drivers are all corrupt, 8/10 (bangalore) they will call you up to ask for your destination (which they are not supposed to know) then if they dont like it or if you refuse to tell them they will waste your time sitting in some gully trying to force you to cancel. Yes, it is 8 times out of 10, i am not exaggerating.

&#x200B;

Swiggy, zomato etc - complete garbage. They take the payment but take 0 real responsiblity for what is delivered. Have had 500 rs orders only half delivered, and they refuse to replace or refund giving me a 50 rupee coupon for 250 rupees worth of missing items. Like what the fuck is that? If I wanted to just give away money id stand on a bridge and throw it.

Pizza hut, dominos, other international chains: Completely 100% indianized, only chicken (religous issue? even UAE pizza hut has pork on their menu), KFC removes fries from its menu (but they sell burgers, wtf? and fries are known, world around, to be the highest margin fast food item).

Electricians, handymen, plumbers: never on time, show up whenever they want, get upset when you say you are now busy. Cant install taps correctly (hot is cold, cold is hot), too near the sink so to get water on your hands you have to touch the sink, poor earthing.

ISPs: shit customer service all-round, high speed, yes, but poor connections with high latency, blocking of websites (disgusting to freedom of information)

Mobile service providers: cheap AF, completely overbooked, infrastructure cant cater to the number of people they take on, get 0.2mbps 4g in metros like mg road bangalore even at 2 o clock on a weekday night.

Autos: meter is just for show, at least in bangalore, aggressive, misbehaved if you dont haggle with them off the meter. Dont even know the roads properly.

Cops: useless 100%, show they are advanced with twitter, facebook and incident report apps, 0% response rate (tried to report noise level issue in my area from a nearby construction site, over 30 complaints over 2 months, tweets, facebook messages, no response. One time a cop showed up wasted more of my time than doing anything, takes my picture for some reason, and fucks off.

Even other poorer nations, and other 3rd world countries, are not as shit as ours when it comes to decenly and proper service, public behaviour, etc. This is the shittiest country in the world, to be honest, fuck your Indian pride (proud of what?).

2174,My relatives visited me. And I live with my girlfriend unbeknownst to them. And they lost their shit. And it was a thing of beauty. (Re-posting because violated some rules earlier),2587,87f85p,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/87f85p/my_relatives_visited_me_and_i_live_with_my/,639,"Backstory: Last week I broke my ankle and there's a cast around it.  
And also, I tend to be one of the lucky guys in India who lives with his girlfriend. But also unlucky in the sense that a handful of my relatives also live in Delhi.

Here's a highlight of how my last 5 days have been when they visited

* Initially I had to endure gasps, shudders and shivers of them when they realize about my ""Living arrangement"" and how ""apposit Jendaars"" are not supposed to live together.

* Then I experienced a satisfaction almost equal to 1/10th of an orgasm when I saw their faces while they ""inform"" my dad(who couldn't give two shits about it. He's cool like that.)

* Then some other bullshit was uttered around me about homeopathy, patanjali or some pehelwan in some gali or chowk who can cure me within a minute.

* Then came a 2nd wave of gasps and horrific squeals when they realized there is no temple or statue at home.

* In the evening my girlfriend comes from work, so naturally my relatives **HAD** to know what her parents do, earn, spend, overpronate, underpronate???

* Then when they were checking out the rest of the house and saw that the bedroom is being shared (and this is the best part) they acted as if I've murdered their children.

* My bua also got disgusted when she found out I was washing both of ours clothes as it is *ladies* work (This is the only time I was legit pissed) 

* My gf has a full sleeve tattoo for which my maami had a questionnaire ready

* Honb'l mention- It was Navratri and the maid had prepared chicken and rice in Lunch so that was fun.

* Another honb'l mention: All of them know that I drink. Because I got many of my cousins drunk in a family wedding some years back. But when they found the bottles and asked me whether she drinks or not and when I said yes she does. Their immediate response was *But girls can't drink.*  
As if it's anatomically impossible for chicks to drink alcohol.

And I am 24 btw. Just for perspective for how ridiculous they are.

Also my mom told me last night that she got a call from everyone saying  ""*Ladka bohot open ho gaya hai. Iski shaadi karado.*""",Non-Political

* Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

* Will illegal muslims immigrants from these 3 countries be automatically deported under this bill? Ans. No. The usual process applies. Their application for naturalisation as citizens will be as per the governing law and based on demerits of the case

* Can Hindus facing persecution in other countries apply under this law? Ans. No

* Does this bill apply to other forms of persecution – Political, racial, sexual etc? Ans. No. The bill is very specific in its intent – religious persecution of above notified minorities in these 3 countries

* Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan

* What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils

* Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve. But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

* Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Now, let's address them. 

>Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way.

That's blatantly false. The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship. 

NRC will follow after CAB. Amit Shah said this himself: https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1205047059654402048

**[Here’s Amit Shah saying non-Muslims won’t even need to submit documents for NRC since they’ll be given citizenship anyway.](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1207191726785323008)**

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

India is not a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol, nor does it have a legal framework and national refugee status determination system. 

So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. 

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

No, they don't have to go through the ""usual process of acquiring citizenship"". They are under-trial for the crime of entering India illegally or overstaying their visas. The Indian law that governs illegal immigrants is The Foreigners Act, 1946. Under this law, illegal immigrants have to deported back to their country. They don't get citizenship. 

>Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan.

Among our neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka has a track record of persecuting Tamils, Burma of persecuting Muslims, and China of persecuting Tibetans and Muslims. So no, those three countries are not special. 

>What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils.

That's not the point. The point is that we already have Sri Lankan refugees and they have been specifically excluded from this act. 

[ Sri Lankan Tamil refugees— those who fled ethnic violence and those who were born here— fear deportation in the aftermath of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that excludes them.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/citizenship-act-aftermath-sri-lankan-tamil-refugees-live-fear-deportation-114097)

>Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.

All completely false. As answered above, India is not a party to UN convention on refugees so India is actually not playing by UN rules. We are legally not required to (before CAB) host any refugees. 

>But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

Apart from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are countries with which India enjoys good diplomatic relations. A better (and more diplomatic) approach would have been to work with them and improve the lot of minorities in those countries. [Bangladesh is already unhappy at us because we clubbed them with Afghanistan and Pakistan](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bangladesh-india-citizenship-amendment-bill-pak-afghanistan-modi-hasina-1628304-2019-12-14)


>Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Again false, there are basically no existing laws under which they can claim asylum in India. We are deporting them.

I want to bring to your attention a possible scam on youtube, and wanted your advice on how to proceed.

I won a phone giveaway contest on the popular tech channel PhoneRadar, in July. PhoneRadar is a pretty huge tech channel, with 924K followers on YT. I was supposed to get an Oppo R17 pro. I was really excited and messaged him my email ID. He replies to me a month later asking me to provide my address within 24 hours, or else I get disqualified, and I sent him my details.

Several months passed by. I kept emailing him once every few days asking about the status. He finally replied on 1st November saying ""I will get back to you soon."". No reply since.

&#x200B;

Eventually I started posting on his videos begging him to reply, but no response.

Today I tweeted on his handle telling him to stop ignoring giveaway winners, which really pissed him off. He says and I quote:"" We don't ignore anyone. You kept spamming questioning without a reason and hence no update happened. You had won the R17 Pro & once we see that you stop the spam and remove the messages we will initiate the shipment. ""

So he didnt ship the phone because I asked for the status twice or thrice a month? And he calls me a spammer for that!Its a blatant lie, and what's worse? Its going to fly because his followers will blindly support him.

Please advise what I should do next. Is there any way to bring more attention to his lie and tweets?I have provided proofs of my emails here. I have always been patient and polite to him.

email proofs: [https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9](https://imgur.com/a/CO2YUV9)him declaring me as the winner on YT:  [https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by](https://imgur.com/a/fUA78by)

My tweet which eventually forced his reply: [https://twitter.com/Cri5\_09/status/1202190915990781953](https://twitter.com/Cri5_09/status/1202190915990781953)

Note: His twitter handle is [https://twitter.com/amitbhawani](https://twitter.com/amitbhawani) and he is the owner of Phoneradar.

Thanks.

&#x200B;

Update: I got a whatsapp message from a guy claiming to be from the PhoneRadar team. He apologizes and says its not Amit's fault as a lot of people falsely claim the phone. I am really pissed off at this point. Silly excuse, but I feel bad for the guy taking the fall for this.They are now saying they will ship the phone this weekend. Told him I dont care uch about the phone now. Oh, and this reddit post made a lot of noise. Thanks r/india. He is asking me to delete my  reddit posts and tweets! I said I am happy to add an update in the end to say I got the phone, but I am no way deleting my posts and tweets. Thats ridiculous 

Update 2: He deleted his tweet. 

Update 3: As you all might have seen from his recent tweet, I got an email from him apologizing for the issue. Perhaps the only good thing they have done so far. I asked him to send out prizes to all giveaway winners and update proofs on his website giveaway page. It hasn't been updated with winner names for a while now. 

Update 4: RIP inbox.

Thanks @sideonion for the gold. Really appreciate it. Thanks to Anon for the silver!

Update 5: Finally got the phone today. Had promised to gift it to my Sister for her birthday in September, got the phone on my birthday today.

There was no sign about exact toll to be paid, everyone paid a fixed price, some paid none. That made me suspect of scheme. 

So I made an RTI application, asking cost of bridge, copy of toll collection GO, vendor collecting the toll currently, how much toll period is left etc. The Bridge dept made my application to travel from dept to dept for a year and half. Ultimately gave me almost everything (I need to send application to another dept for part of application) In mean time, I used to ask my relatives about status of bridge toll JLT. and I got to know that one fine day (within 2 weeks, after receiving RTI reply) with lot of fanfare local politician said that he is doing a seva to public by removing the toll on on all such bridges, 13 in total.

Fun Fact: 

* 1. I filed RTI only for one bridge and this corruption was found that bridge dept, local mafia, police and politicians were milking 3-4 lakhs everyday. 5000 vehicles on each bridgex Rs 5 per vehicle x 13 bridges = 3.25 lakh. 
* 2. Cost of bridge (23 lakh) was not recovered even after 25 years. Irony is local politician trying to be saint/hero by not involving in corruption.
* 3. I happen to meet someone who bragged about his uncle being the toll collector for toll station I had filed RTI, while this whole thing was going on.

I could do all these as I was using office address, whose entry was heavily regulated under STPI laws. **It is 10 years now, but I have been told to never talk about this to anyone, else I may get killed.** Crazy.",Policy/Economy

BUT THEY MUST.,2268,ar504q,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ar504q/people_dont_understand_the_differences_between/,144,"So I was talking to a friend yesterday who was disturbed by the recent Pulwama attack and during the conversation she referred to the victims as the Indian army soldiers. It wasn't very surprising for me as I've been seeing this misconception for years, even among the educated lot of the country. However, the cowardly attack on CRPF really boiled my blood and I strongly felt that they deserved to be addressed as who they are. And they are not the army. 

Following five forces were earlier considered paramilitary forces, but from March 2011 have been reclassified as Central Armed Police Forces to avoid confusion with Assam Rifles and Special Frontier Force (SFF):

    Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) 
    Border Security Force (BSF) 
    Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) 
    Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) 
    Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB)

CRPF is like the first responder for almost all of the internal security or ""war-like"" situations whereas the army is brought in during the war. CRPF faces the stone pelters in Kashmir. It is they who face bullets of the naxals. BSF guards our borders, not the army always. They have to make way for the army when a war is imminent. ITBP is stationed along the Indo-Tibetan border protects us from the Chinese forces. 

The CRPF or the CAPF in general, comes under the Ministry Of Home Affairs while the army comes under the Ministry Of Defence. MHA has almost equal number of mouths to feed, if not more, compared to the MoD but the MoD takes a substantially bigger piece of the budget pie everytime because MoD procurements are expensive (remember Rafale? I only wonder how all that extra money could have been utilized).

CAPF is not treated on par with the army even in terms of pay & perks. 

>A low-ranking army soldier typically receives one-and-a-half times the pay of a CRPF officer of equivalent experience

>“We’re like a body,” he said, referring to all the security forces, including the army. “Just because the heart is more important, you can’t ignore the knee.”

CAPF personnel live in very poor and conflict ridden conditions for very extended periods of time (remember the BSF jawan's viral video complaining low standards of food?). The conditions that they live in are so dire that diseases like malaria, dengue, heart attacks, depression and suicides kill 16 times more CRPF personnel in maoist hit regions compared to those slain by the rebels. 

>Junior home minister Hansraj Gangaram Ahir told the Lok Sabha that 74 CRPF personnel were killed in offensives against the rebels, while 1,196 lost their lives because of medical reasons. In a written reply, the minister said 219 jawans succumbed to heart attacks, 77 died because of depression or by committing suicide, and 20 due to malaria and dengue. Another 880 died due to ""other"" unspecified medical reasons.

They even have a hard time rehabilitating after retirements. Suicide rates are very high in the paramilitary both during and post service.

> Nearly 700 personnel of the Central Armed Police Forces committed suicide in the last six years, more than those killed in action, the Union Home Ministry has told a parliamentary panel. The reasons include ""lack of stability, loneliness and domestic strife"".

TL;DR:

We comfortably deify the army but we don't understand that it is not just the army that is keeping us safe. Being able to make this distinction between our various forces gives us the ability to address their critical concerns. Let us not be so thankless. Let us not be so ignorant. Let us give these brave CAPF soldiers the recognition and status they deserve. 

But more importantly let us pay them well for their services because they are not just fighting for honour, they are also fighting to feed their loved ones, to send their kids to college, to build a house, to pay their old parents' medical bills. In addition to fighting for the country,  these soldiers are fighting for themselves like you and me.

2275,Does my period really makes me impure?,2256,b0gd70,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b0gd70/does_my_period_really_makes_me_impure/,851,"I despise my periods not because they hurt me, but because of the amount of crappy rules I'm made to follow. It's unbelievable that people find it so hard to move on with time. If anyone of you have seen the movie padman, you know what I'm talking about. 

I am 17 and started getting my period at 13. And just as my period began I realised the shit load of rules my mom follows. We don't touch anything at home not even our own stuff. I am asked to just sit in a secluded room all day with a dirty blanket not washed since ages. I can't even go get myself a glass of water on the first day. Not allowed to touch any person at home not allowed to sit on my bed touch my phone or books anything else. Not allowed to go to kitchen or my own room. And I don't get a single speck of food on the first day of my period. And when I say a single speck it's literal. By the second day I'm so weak that it's difficult to walk. Even though agreed it's all for one day but my life literally stops.

It's not that my mom is a bad person, she is great and the amount of sacrifices she has done for me is unbelievable. But it's sad that even my crying for food doesn't melt her. She believes that because we have a small Mandir at home we are required to follow all this. 

Does my period really make me so impure?

Edit: Thank you for all the love and support! I honestly didn't know this was that big of a problem until you people pointed it out. Especially the not eating thing. I didn't know it can have long term effects. The problem with that is that if I force my mother to let me eat then she will make me stay in that hell disgusting room for whole 2 days. Sounds like a punishment for eating. 2 days doing nothing looking at walls. That disgusts me a lot I feel like a wasted body or something.",AskIndia

2286,I started my Btech degree yesterday at the age of 25.,2225,ciddbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ciddbn/i_started_my_btech_degree_yesterday_at_the_age_of/,462,"For those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor's after the age of 21, I started my btech degree at the age of 25. Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)


Thanks,


Failure at 25.

Last night, I got done at the gym and went to the supermarket next to the gym to grab some food.

Here's the mind-blowing overall medal tally:

- Gold : 85
- Silver : 154
- Bronze : 129

I had posted a just few days ago on how investing heavily in only a handful of ""profitable talents"" viz. dance, singing, comedy and cricket; and media's blatant neglect of other talents might discourage talented individuals from pursuing their interests in other fields of sports and art. 

And today I read about these champions of indomitable determination. They proved how, despite their hardships, special abilities and limited support, one can make history. One must also applaud their parents and well wishers for truly believing in their children when the world generally looks down upon people with special needs & abilities.

Most of these sports persons will soon return to their normal lives full of obstacles. I only hope that these men & women of passion get as much support and nurturing as possible from the govt as well as the society. They made India proud. They deserve to be rewarded and rewarded well for bringing glory to the nation. And more importantly for bringing a ray of hope in the lives of millions of others.

[Their homecoming pictures are the best thing I've seen today.](http://www.newindianexpress.com/galleries/sport/2019/mar/24/special-olympics-indias-medal-winners-return-home-amidst-glitzy-and-glory-102173.html)

These are the smiles that deserved extensive coverage in the media. They deserved interviews. Their stories deserved to be told. They have the potential to inspire and change lives. But, alas, hardly did we even realize that such an incredible feat was even accomplished in India.

I have been investing for 5 years. a year ago I had a portfolio of 59 lakh of which 45 belonged to my dad and 14 was mine. after a fight with my dad i had to stop investing as it was his account. 2months later he agreed to give me my 14 lakh and told me to gtfo.

6 months back my mom got a bulge in her l4-l5 lumbar spine. my dad refused to pay for her treatment so i had to chip in.

2410,My Covid-19 quarantine experience,1951,ffyots,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffyots/my_covid19_quarantine_experience/,158,"I live and work in Shenzhen, China and was traveling for work in the US when the virus epidemic happened in China. Since it was Chinese New Year holidays, I thought I’ll head to Bali (via HK) for a short vacay and then head back to Shenzhen.
As the news of the epidemic becoming severe, I decided to go back to Bangalore,India.

This is where the fun starts:
- ON FEBRUARY 6, I land in Bangalore and the doctor in front of the immigration asks me where am I coming from and I say Bali and he let’s me go. (No temperature checks)
- at immigration, the officer doesn’t check my travel/visa history at all and I had to report myself that I live in China, the officer takes me to another officer and he just lets me pass immigration as they were instructed to only check folks who have a travel history to China after Jan 24

A week later I have a bad cold (I have a weak immunity) and since I have a crazy travel history and didn’t want to take risk and endanger people, so I call the helpline and they ask me if I spoke any Hindi (I didn’t) and they disconnected..
So I went to the official government center (Rajiv Gandhi chest diseases hospital) and report myself.
The staff were friendly and professional and they took my samples and took a chest X-ray and they found air-blockages around my chest and suspected it would be a pneumonia.So I was isolated and quarantined.

My family were not happy that I reported myself and the hospital ‘held’ me in quarantine for 2 days until my results came back ‘negative’ for the virus.

The quarantine facility  was not super great but clean and adequate and the staff took good care of me, provided meals and medicine on time until my results came out.
I was not allowed to go out of the isolation building and the family was not recommended to meet me, the silver lining is that the building was well lit with sunlight and you could hear birds chirping all day and you’re away from all the bangalore hustle and bustle.
It was a giant relief for me that the test results came out negative since I live in a joint family here in Blr.

TLDR; 
- travelled around a lot
- officers at the immigration were not very serious about the virus situation
- felt sick, reported myself and got quarantined in the government hospital 
- quarantine was not bad at all
- results for covid-2019 came back negative 

If you have symptoms, report yourself.",Non-Political

I am going through a lot. Wanted to come here and rant but when i see good post, i just think, maybe post it next day.

So I first saw this boy (around 8 years old ) at a bus stand and there was something in him which i cant shake off. The way he stands, the way he looks. Dressed poorly, didn't eat for a long time, selling fruits/flowers roadside from morning to night. 
I wanted to talk to him but he didn't first few days. I used to buy things from him just because i wanted to help him.

 Finally couple of weeks later, he started talking and i  cried that whole day. His parent died when he was too young to talk. Was living with some relatives who were real bad with him. He used to do all home chores but when he said he want to go to school, they took him to another cities bus stand and left.

Its been 6 months, I've been helping him in all the possible ways with study material, food and neccesory cloths. He dont want to go to any anathalay as well. 

There is a couple in mid 50s I know very well and when i talked about him, they said they are willing to adapt him but this boy dont want to become any ones responsibility.

Finally, he agreed on one condition that i visit him every week and the couple do not have to worry about this expenses. I know this couple from some time and i know he will get the best care.

All my rants about life just vanished. Problems are still there. I earn very less but will continue to provide him monetary and other necessities every month. It gives a great feeling which you just can not describe in words. 

Name of boy - Ivaan

Have a blessed day all!

2445,"[NP] I called the police and ambulance on a road accident victim. Ambulance shows up in 4 min, police show up in 20.",1870,a3karl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a3karl/np_i_called_the_police_and_ambulance_on_a_road/,165,"As described above. Last night on the way from the airport to my place, we saw a body lying in the middle of a three lane road with vehicles overtaking from the either side of him.

I then maneuvered my car to block the middle lane, by stopping the car on the lane, with indicators on.

The accident must have happened not more than 5 min before we reached that spot.

So I called the police. And an ambulance. I called the ambulance first, gave the operator a location, but he didn't know where that was, so the operator asked if I will talk with the ambulance driver and I agreed. I then called police.

As titled, the ambulance was really fast, reached the accident location within 5 min. The police took much longer to show up at about twenty minutes. We spoke with the police for about 5 min and went on our way.

In the end, even though we looked like the perpetrator (when we stopped in front of the victim to block traffic), the police didn't give us any problems.

The purpose of this post was to highlight how the bystander effect is so true. Nobody thought of calling and ambulance or police. Nobody waited to help the victim. Also surprised that an ambulance can show up so quickly.

edit : I have a dashcam. [I just uploaded the file here.](https://gfycat.com/WindingNeedyCod)

edit 2: as u/boredmonk pointed out, I dialed 108 for the ambulance and 100 for police from my friend's mobile phone (on international roaming). No Country code or city code required.

It has been a few years, and I've traveled to other places since, but lately memories from India have helped me stay strong.

Whether it be strolling in the ancient ruins around Hampi, Karnatka, climbing giant boulders and feeling like the king of the world;

Or drifting in the crazy haze of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, feeling the insane energy of life and death strip me of my identity, as I become just another body in the crowd;

Watching the mists roll over the tea plantations in Munnar, Kerala, the light rain on my skin, and feeling inner peace;

Not being able to smile for my photo in front of the Taj Mahal, because I was overcome by beauty and grief;

Climbing to the top of the crowded waterfall in Bhagsu, Himachal Pradesh, and suddenly finding myself Isolated in a beautiful stream, alone save a solitary monk taking a bath in one of the pools;

walking around giant temple complexes in Tamil Nadu, Marveling at the dedication and power of their builders;

Being escorted by a friendly dog half way to the Kheerganga hot springs in Parvati valley, her patiently waiting for me every time I have to slow down;

Getting tremendous help from like 500 different beautiful people whenever I needed something, all over this country;

And finally, quietly sitting in the meditation room in the Buddha memorial park in Patna, Bihar, and finally accepting that it's time to go back home.


Thank you, India. Thank you for all these memories, and a thousand more. I love you and I miss you. Stay the crazy, unique, powerful, beautiful, **wonderful** place that you are.

Had an argument with some obnoxious colleagues in the morning. They are seniors who throw their weight around, and today spent 20 minutes shouting at a hapless office boy, for not keeping a glass of hot tea ready on their desk when they walked in.

They threatened to fire him and reduced him to tears.

I had enough and walked over to them and gave them their due piece of mind. I brought up the history of unacceptable treatment they've been meting out to the office boys and maids, snapping their fingers at them, abusing them over trivial matters, calling them for menial tasks they were well capable of doing themselves.

I stated very loudly that firing the office boys over flimsy charges would lead to cases in the labour court, and the office boy was stunned to know that was even an option.

The arrogant buddhas huffed and puffed and complained to the head of the office, who called me in. Since I work for the Corporate office and don't report to him, he couldn't boss me around, so he told me to calm down and not ""upset the seniors"" in the company. He told me that office boys were used to being treated this way, since ""it's part of their job"".

To anyone still reading, please rid yourselves of this attitude. Office boys and maids are human beings, not servants*. They deserve the same respect, dignity, and kindness you expect from your company.

Please make an effort to know their names (""Arre, Suno"" is not their name!!!!), talk to them once in a while, thank them when they make you a cup of tea, warm your food in the microwave, or come to your desk with some prasad or cake that some other colleague wishes to distribute in the office.

Wash your plates/containers/teacups after eating/drinking. Office is not a hotel, so it's not their duty to clean your utensils.

If you've spilled something on your desk/floor and they have to clean it, apologise to them for the inconvenience. 

If you have to stay back late for work, please take the office keys from them and offer to lock up the office yourself. They typically have to travel far to their home and have to report early to the office, so it's not fair for you to keep them waiting endlessly late in the day. Same for the Sundays when you have to report for duty.

Stand up for them if you see a colleague misbehaving or treating them callously. 

TLDR: Treat your office boys and maids like colleagues. Getting treated like shit is not part of their ""job"". Don't be a lazy slob and take care of minor things yourself in the office.

Thanks for reading, and apologies if I've offended anyone. 

*Edit: Just to add, servants should also be treated with respect and dignity.

2524,[Update] Unable to pay college fee. Need financial assistance...,1760,8v98cy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8v98cy/update_unable_to_pay_college_fee_need_financial/,105,"A few weeks ago I approached /r/India in distress, after rushing from banks to banks and talking to whoever I can, I was unable to arrange even 1/3rd of the magic 1.6LPM number which could help me pay the fee. The college was not so supportive and banks were reluctant because for some reason I can't get study loan between the course, and some have not even replied till date.

I had offered to create app/website for randians in exchange of some loan, but instead the community came together helped me raise enough amount that I could pay my final year college fee, something i never expected from my fav sub.

I really want to thank the mods who helped me with the idea of fund raiser, 25 of you who helped me financially and hundreds of individual who offered useful  advice, kept asking me if I needed any more help, some were even willing to offer me internship/projects to work on to cover my expenses. It's due to r/India that I was finally able to [pay my fee](https://i.imgur.com/cmP1DXM.png) with a fine of Rs. 200 though.

Not only the community where I have spent hundreds of hours helped me in most generous way possible, as a result of my post seeking help, I made few friends and got to talk to experienced individuals who gave me useful advice related to my college, career and the world in general.

I am really thankful to this community and the mods for helping me out. The community didn't only help me in this case but also my dozens of other posts asking advice for ""friend"" and my alts :D

Thank you everyone one more time, love you all \<3",[R]eddiquette

He makes jokes on Disney(He jokes on many people, corporations anyway). I observed a cut in scene and suspected a censorship. Immediately went to YouTube and watched that particular segment, which clearly didn't have anything censored. This was a particular recurring scene where he says ""Disney Facts"" over a set of jokes.

Hotstar is doing this even after being paid for a premium subscription. Similar censorship has happened in the past after Disney acquisition.

Edit : 
This blew up more than I thought it would. NDTV published an article on this reddit post. Hope hotstar stops censoring. Great going guys!

The retarded CM of Goa has imposed a full lockdown. This means that NO grocery shops are allowed to open. I might survive for a week by eating a single meal per day with a dangerously compromised immunity during this ongoing pandemic, but think of the numerous infants and elderly dependents who need supplements and special medications and form the most vulnerable sections prone to COVID-19.

**The state of Goa has also breached the centre's direct order by shutting down ALL food supplies and outlets in the state.**

Foreign nationals stuck in the state are already trying to get international media's attention to this crisis , but we need more voices!

The nail in the coffin for me was seeing [THIS](https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/1243078456671236098) tweet by Delhi's CM. He's allowed 24X7 operation of all grocery stores in his jurisdiction which felt like a gut-punch as a Goan. We haven't had fresh supply in nearly five days!

Please do not trust any news outlet or journalists claiming that Goa has things under control. Goan government's policy is literally murdering its own people to tackle COVID-19.

If Corona doesn't get us, starvation surely will. If you can, at the very least, tweet, tag, or shame the Goan administration. It's a total nightmare!  


**EDITS:**

Someone just filed a petition against Goa's government: 

[Advocate Rohit Bras de Sa files letter petition before HC on account of scarcity of essential commodities & lack of machanism to provide basic food supply to vulnerable wage workers, says people of Goa are struggling to find even basic goods to sustain themselves in curfew days](https://twitter.com/prudentgoa/status/1243101931666468869)

If you want to lend your support on Twitter, retweet the following tweet en mass. It's from Zoe, a foreign national, who's been trying to get international media's attention on the issue:

Just like how you were once new to the internet and you were amazed and puzzled by different things, they will also experience the same, but the difference is that they are like the new student who joined the school in the middle of the year. They have to now put twice as effort than you did in the past because everything has evolved so much and there are so many things to know about.

They are new to everything and they will be naive. They will fall into scams and will be exploited. They will be made fun of as they don't know the social etiquette of the internet which you have got used to. They may not even understand English properly or may not understand the underlying technologies which may seem obvious to you.

However, remember that you were also like that once up a time. Perhaps you were privileged to be able to use the internet while it was still a young new thing, but imagine how you would have felt if everyone you met online were a bully to you. Remember that Internet became what it is because there were forums and sites for helping each other on every topic you can think of.

I am cancelling my connections and I hope what I say in this post are compelling enough for you to support me.",1659,aeblpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aeblpo/r_please_dont_get_jio_gigafiber_and_i_have/,477,"I am copying and pasting from a [comment I made in another thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/adu4hg/indias_massive_jio_carrier_is_blocking_vpn_sites/edkyke4/), after someone suggested that I should make a thread about this.

Jio is using

1. Deep packet inspection
2. Carrier-grade NAT
3. Poorly configured stateful IPv6
4. Almost completely locked down router with some non-sequitor options
5. Clueless customer service, who just say ""we can't talk about X or Y or Z"" and who often do not even understand the question. If you ask about IPv6 settings, they'll say they can't help you, and then proceed to misinterpret it as a request for a static IP address. 

The first two are reasons enough to not use this shitty ISP.

To explain in more detail:

1. Every bit of data transmitted on the internet is transmitted as a packet. Think of this packet as a [matryoshka doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll). What Jio does is open these dolls to see what the innermost dolls look like. That obliterates your privacy. Jio is using software that is good enough to deny you service even if you use strong encryption. I believe that heuristic analysis and the use of known signatures is a part of the firewall.
2. Before the days of IPv4 pool saturation, you would get a public IPv4 address (or even more than one) from your ISP, while your LAN would have a private IP address from a range reserved by the IETF (such as 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x). When these addresses became more scarce, ISPs moved to dynamic allocation, so unused addresses in their range would be recycled for other customers to use based on uptime. However, each customer still received a unique public IP address. Eventually, people decided that the principles used on large enterprise LANs could be applied to ISPs as well. On a service with CG-NAT, your public IP address is now shared with many other customers.
 * This is bad for several reasons, and performance and reliability are two of them. For instance, you could have trouble transmitting UDP packets across two routing tables. On a poorly configured network though, security is an even bigger concern, because you can expose multiple customer subnets to each other. The firewall on their router is a major cause for concern. The default is to allow all connections, rather than only established or related connections, while blocking others.
3. IPv6 was introduced with the aim of mitigating the shortage of network addresses, and to also reduce the workload on network infrastructure, by changing the way addresses are assigned. I will not get into too much detail as I am no expert on IPv6 networking and haven't really messed around with it until I got Jio, but I can assure you that they are not following the guidelines or best practices for deploying IPv6.
 * For instance, WAN is assigned in a stateful manner, with only a /128 address being given to your router. Your LAN is by default configured to be stateless, with a /64 prefix length. However your LAN prefix is not assigned by the ISP, but is instead assigned from a reserved linked-local IPv6 range defined in an outdated RFC. So you literally get none of the benefits of IPv6, and all of the downsides of IPv4, as a NAT is involved in your connection.
4. Bridging mode is completely broken. You still need to configure your WAN interface even when you want to bridge the Jio router to your own equipment.
5. Jio's customer service is brain-dead retarded, and will simply refuse to help if you want anything more than basic troubleshooting. They also don't have any L2 or higher technicians available on the phone. Also, the best part is that their TSP and ISP divisions are separate, yet they seem to use the same customer care number! God help you if you call from your registered mobile number, because then you will be quickly connected to a human from one department, who will promptly refuse to look at issues involving the other department, and you will completely fail to connect to that particular department. They won't even transfer your call! Also when you use a non-registered number to get around this and provide them your registered mobile number, they have no means of identifying which service tickets belong to which department.
 * When I raised a complaint with the fiber department, and then called the jiofi department to register a separate complaint, the jiofi team would insist that the ticket was raised for jiofi, and when I raised a ticket with the jiofi team, the fiber team would insist that the ticket was raised for fiber!

I will admit that I am still using the JioFi connection, but that is because I paid for a year of service, and that only gets used for things like netflix and amazon prime when I am on the move. It's not ideal, but I'm kinda stuck with that one.",Science/Technology

2619,Rant: In India everything matters except the real issues.,1633,e5rae3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5rae3/rant_in_india_everything_matters_except_the_real/,353,"Have you ever felt that us Indians have this sick tendency to completely ignore the elephant in the room while we whine and get offended about every single thing that is not important? As an Indian international student; after observing the Western European education system, I am shocked to see how radically different it is than our own system. I personally think that it is due to the fact that us Indians are conditioned since we are toddlers to put our unrelenting faith in our ""elders"". The only problem is that many of our so called  ""elders"" are also normal human beings with their own problems and flaws. 

When I first went abroad, I remember how some of our jealous relatives were taunting my parents about how I will lose all my ""culture"", ""riti-riwaz"" after stepping out the country even though I was only going for a couple of months. I literally had to touch the feet of 10 thousand different people to get a proper dose of ashirwad before finally boarding the plane and literally had a back pain throughout the entire flight. Our parents have panick attacks if you don't say a proper namaste to a random ""aunty"" who you don't give a flying fuck about; you are taught fake history both at home and school where you are force-fed the idea of andh deshbhakti; you get told that countries such as US and UK are only successful because of the Indians scientists and doctors working there, and that you should feel lucky to be born in such a beautiful pure society. I also had narcissist relatives telling me that instead of feeling disenfranchised, I should be happy that at least I was born in a upper cast family. 

  
My point is simple. I really do not mind culture, traditions, riti or riwaz. I think they all have their own place and can add a certain level of beauty to a culture; however, I do believe that they should never supersede real world problems, facts and logic that this country is so deprived of.  

This is also where it gets really dark. If you are someone who has ability to think critically or you're someone with a certain level of common sense, living in India can be so overbearing because there is so much focus on symbolism. You don't touch the feet of your relatives? You scoundrel! You come late to a pooja? That's sacrilege! You hang out with non vegetarian friends? Chiee!!  You believe India can be more secular? deshdhrohi! 

I honestly do not blame Whatsapp or any big media company for the wave of anti-intellectualism in India. It is easy to make fun of these corporations by using words such as ""Whatsapp university"" and ""Facebook pathshala"" but the underlying disgusting mentality that is so pervasive in our society is the root cause of why we are not progressing on a global scale. Whatsapp university is not making us dumb, it is just spreading our omnipresent dumbness in a more effective manner. 

Many of our parents or relatives get triggered if you don't put a tika on your forehead after a religious ceremony but they spit out pan openly in the streets with complete impunity and disregard for local laws. Another real life example is of a person I know who got into an accident due to open potholes in the monsoon season. Instead of blaming the municipality for this, he believed that it happened to him because he did not brake a coconut after purchasing his vehicle. 

In schools you they force you to sing absolute bull shit slogans like ""bacche man ke sacche"" when this country has  one of the highest rates of rapes of underage girls, and in many schools in India if you dare to question your teacher, you get harassed and abused mentally, emotionally and physically. 

You go to a wedding in some parts of the country and it is a common sight to see hungry kids gathering around the tent to look for thrown leftovers by people, while on the other hands the women worry about the colors of their sarees. I do not even understand how these people can digest that food while looking at the eyes of those hungry kids. The more you travel around the world, the more you realize how devoided people of India are of any empathy or compassion towards their fellow citizens! 

How can this country move forward when it focuses so much on frivolous symbolism and have that level of cultural baggage on its back. And yes! I know! There are other countries that have the same problem; however, I was born in India and it disturbs me that our country does not have its priorities straight, and probably never will!

The absolute worst part about all of this is that if you dissent or do not agree with the way the our society works then they point the finger at you and make you feel like as if you are the wrong one! If you refuse to partake in the mass shared delusion and psychosis of the ""cultured"" Indian society, there is something wrong with you as a person!   


I try my best everyday to remain optimistic about our country but whenever I open up the news, whatsapp, twitter; or even listen to my own relatives and friends, I feel utterly nihilistic. I hope things take turns for the better in India but I won't bet my money on it so because when you combine religion, symbolism, politics, and fake superiority complex, then you have an absolute mess and chaos on your hands.

Sorry for my prolonged rant but I do believe that if Indian society was a person, it would be diagnosed with a severe case of Narcissistic personality disorder.",Politics

Ours is a resource limited setting, a poor nation with dirt poor patients. The whole country is in lockdown and people are in frenzy. The cases aren’t that many but they’re increasing fast. Our government has this shitty criteria to decide who gets screened for COVID and who doesn’t. Only the symptomatic people with either a history of travel abroad in past 2 weeks or those with a direct contact with a confirmed case get tested. This criteria is so stringent that out of the hundred people that I see in a day, I hardly send one or two for testing. And I am not even counting the hundreds who are attended at a separate ‘flu clinic’ and don’t even see the face of the screening centre. I don’t know whether the government can’t afford the testing kits or it doesn’t want to reveal the true picture, all I know is that we are sitting on a time bomb. What I hate the most is arguments with patients. They come a long way, facing a lot of hardships just to reach our centre and we are forced to turn them away. Literally every single person I see over a six hour period calls me useless because I won’t test them. They’re frustrated and so am I. My hands are tied by the rules and they just need someone to take it out on, and we keep on being the scapegoats in between. I used to be the kind of person who would reach first to the hospital and would be the last to leave but I hate going to work now, I dread talking to people knowing all I am going to do is let them down. Not to mention the hardships I have to face just to reach the hospital from my place of residence because our government has shut down literally every mode of conveyance. So I walk an hour everyday to work only to be cursed by patients and only to put my own health at risk. Please advise your children to not become a doctor. Atleast not in this country.",Unverified

For it was a nation who discriminated against religion. For it was a nation who fueled terrorism against said religion. And so I did. 


* I rejoiced when their prime minister got imprisoned. 

* I rejoiced when their image in the world was reduced to a terrorist nation. 

* I rejoiced each time our cricket team won against theirs. 

* I rejoiced when their diplomatic relationships were shattered. 


As I walked in the mist of ignorance rarely did I see the hypocrisy of my own country, and how could I? It was so pure and true. How can Mother India be anything but holy? 


And as the mist grew thick, I saw the hate crimes against the Muslims of our country. I felt infuriated for I was taught to conjure brotherhood towards all the people of my beloved country.
But how could I? 
*Was I not supposed to discriminate against the Muslims for that is what my ever so righteous parents did?*
All I was but a green child, and so I kept quiet. 



* I kept quiet as they were killed for eating beef. 

* I kept quiet as their fortunes were stripped away by the mobs of unruly. 
* I kept quiet as the government increasingly drifted away from harbouring secularism. 
* I kept quiet as hate crimes became rampant.
* I kept quiet as students were harassed. 



But now the Eastern wind blows wild and the mist falls. As my eyes adjust to the darkness, I grow grave with fear that my beloved country is becoming the very thing I was taught to despise. 

*Was I not taught the virtues of secularism? 
Was I not taught the value of equality? 
How can I let my country become the pit of what it stood on?*

The journey takes 46 hours via train. Usually I travel with friends/classmates but I had to stay back a few days so I'm on my own. 

Anyway, I was allotted a lower berth in 2nd ac. Perfect, I thought. I've got a bad back and climbing into the upper berth does it no favours. Things were going well till my berthmates arrived. 

It's a family. A couple and 2 kids. They ask me if I can move to the upper berth to feed their kids and I can come back down after. I'm like ok, cool. I've travelled with kids before so I know how it can be. 

Nope. After dinner, they put the kids to sleep. In my berth. Refusing to give it back. Ok, whatever. I'm not going to see them again after I get down. All good, right? 

Nope. They've decided they want the entire fucking thing to themselves so they've been making life hell to get rid of me. Thankfully, I have a friend in another berth so I've been staying there but whenever I come back to get something or to lie down, they begin shouting, playing music, beating the kids (?!) until I leave. They woke me at 5 in the fucking morning blasting shitty music till I got up and left. 

This is a seat that I've paid a fair bit of money for. How in the fuck can people justify this sort of behavior? Fuck this and fuck them. I'm getting down in 6 hours. 6 long, miserable hours.",Non-Political

Heres the short version

Thugs in front of me start a fight with me unprovoked because I did not stand up for the national anthem.

I get hit on the face and they incite a crowd against me. They close in and shouting threats to my life.

INOX PULLS ME OUT, and left the thugs there. Thank e manager was flippant towards me and when the police got involved he wrote his case report supporting the mob and against me.

The thugs basically write some hit down and are left free. I was detained for bogus charges for not standing up and 'hurting the dignity of the soverign nation'

Not one person stood up for me when a mob threated my life. I am absolutely disgusted with everyone that was present yesterday.

Im still seething from the injustice and urge you all to boycott inox. That was absolutely unacceptable.

Also for disclosure, I did unload an unholy fuckton of insults and swears on the thugs and subsequent audience that went after me, they were all triggered. But not once did I threaten bodily harm unprovoked. Nor did I shout threats at peoples lives.",Unverified

That gang was led by Susanta Chowdhury, a criminal under the umbrella of the local politicians. These criminals used to rape every young woman in the small village named Sutiya in West Bengal (2000 to 2002). Sometimes, they went to the house of a villager and raped the women inside the house, often in front of the whole family. They used to keep records of every little girl who became mature enough to rape. People who tried to protest were mercilessly butchered. No reports of rape and murder were allowed to be known to the police or media. 

Barun Biswas, a school teacher organized the villagers against these demons. He led the raped women to go to the police and media. The whole village came out to support the teacher in his fight for justice.

After that there was a great media and public outrage which compelled the police to capture the criminals and bring them to justice. There were 33 rape cases and also 12 murder cases registered against them (the actual number of rapes were atleast 5 or 6 times more). The ring leader with his four main gang members were given life sentences. Some of the accused were released due to lack of evidence.

In 2002, Barun was shot dead by some of the freed members of that gang near Goboardanga railway station while returning from his school. He is a real hero and people of the area still revered him as a legend.

Edit: Barun was shot dead in 2012. Sorry for the mistake.",[R]eddiquette

He seems to be having a really hard time with the adjustment. I want to teach my son some phrases that he can say to the boy so that he knows he has a friend. I don't know what language he speaks but I know he calls his Dad ""Nana""?  Can someone help us with some simple stuff like ""do you want to play"" or ""friend"" or something?  Also any advice would be helpful.

Edit:. Also, I speak only English and Spanish so I need help with pronunciation. :)

Edit:. I'll keep everybody updated. The little boy wasn't at school on Friday because he doesn't come on Fridays I learned. Monday is a holiday here so they won't be in class together until Tuesday at the earliest. My kid picked up on the phrases really quickly and is excited to get to use them!  Thank you so much everybody for your help. I will absolutely let you know how it goes!  Also, thank you for the gold kind stranger!

Update:. Daycare never found out the right language. :(. Although, it doesn't turn out that it really makes a difference. His little friend is picking up English really quickly and not crying anymore at school.  Thank you all so much for your information. It did help my son try and find ways to connect, which means that he made a little friend anyway. Kids really do learn so fast! I'm very glad that my son was sympathetic to his situation.  Thank you good people of r/India!!!",Non-Political
